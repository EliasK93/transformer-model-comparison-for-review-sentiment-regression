__label__5 AMAZINGLY EASY AND FAST! A++++++++  I HAD ALWAYS WANTED TO MAKE "THE SWITCH" BUT NEVER HAD THE GUTS.  WHEN LEOPARD CAME OUT, I BEGAN TO READ ALL THE REVIEWS AND WATCH THE TUTORIALS.  AFTER A FEW MONTHS I WAS CONFIDENT TO MAKE THE JUMP. I WENT TO APPLE TO MAKE THE PURCHASE FIRST AND SAID IT WOULD NOT SHIP FOR A FEW DAYS BUT I WAS READY SO I WENT TO AMAZON AND SAW "ORDER IN THE NEXT 47 MINUTES AND GET IT TOMORROW"  SO I DID THAT.  AND THE NO SALES TAX WAS AMAZING.  THE NEXT MORNING IT ARRIVED.  I PROMPTLY OPENED THE BOX AND PLUGGED IT IN TO CHARGE AND BEGIN TO "PLAY".  I THOUGHT THE 1GB OF RAM WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH BUT I HAD 8 PROGRAMS RUNNING THAT NIGHT WITH ZERO LAG.  I DID UPGRADE TO A 2GB RAM 1 DIMM CARD THOUGH AND ITS PERFECT!!  ALL OF THE MAC PROGRAMS WORK GREAT.  ONE MAC PROGRAM IS NOT WORKING PROPERLAY AND THAT IS MY BLACKBERRY SYNC TOOL BUT IT IS PROBABLY SOMETHING WITH VERIZON.  THE SPEED IS FASTER THAN BOTH OF MY XP LAPTOPS. AND IT SURFS AND DOWNLOADS FASTER THAN BOTH OF THEM.  THE APPLE REMOTE WORKS GREAT EVEN ACCROSS THE ROOM. AND THE .MAC FEATURE HAS WORKED FLAWLESSLY.  I HAVE A BLUETOOTH MOUSE WHICH CONNECTED SO MUCH EASIER THAN ON A PC.  THE SPEAKERS ARE LOUD BUT NOT QUITE LOUD ENOUGH.  THE ONLY THING THAT IS A LITTLE BELOW PAR IS BATTERY LIFE.  I GET ROUGHLY 3-3.5 HOURS OF BATTERY LIFE.  IT DROPS TO 2.5-3 WHEN I AM LISTENING TO MUSIC AND SURFING THE WEB.  I NOW TELL EVERYONE TO MAKE THE SWITCH! I HAVEN'T LOOKED BACK YET!
__label__5 Great business laptop  I am a consultant who is replacing a 3 year old PowerBook G4 867 MHz. Since I don't need the advanced graphics of the MacBook Pro, I got the 2.0 GHz MacBook. It didn't feel that fast with the stock 512 MB RAM, but has performed beautifully since I upgraded it to 2 GB RAM. Universal applications (Mail, Safari, DayLite, OmniGraffle) all snap open and run quickly. Non-Universal applications (MS Office, QuickBooks) also launch quickly and have run very well. Using a FireWire cable to transfer over from my old PowerBook was pure simplicity, and even the search terms I use in Safari copied over (I was stunned).  The only complaints I have (and they are minor) is (1) the keyboard has taken some getting used to, and (2) Front Row performs surprisingly sluggishly. On the second point, since all other applications have performed near-flawlessly, I will assume Apple still has some work to do on Front Row.  From a business standpoint, using Office and QuickBooks on the Mac, and having the ability to load Parallels to run Windows if I encounter an application not native for the Mac), means I can operate in a largely Windows world without having to worry about viruses, malware, etc. (at least, for now).
__label__2 Just got this laptop it's used i know but my goodness it's slow...just using this for school work no roaming the net.
__label__4 Brummo  I've never owned a laptop before so this is premissed by that.  The power is great and it is quick to process what games I have. Setting up to a wifi has been a bit challenging but will work it out.  A couple of movies didn't play in the in drive and had to play them on the regular tv, think they were old and scratched up a bit.  Finger prints are a livable issue given the performance and price.
__label__3 Why a Notebook?  I thought Samsung was coming out with a touch-pad, instead of another laptop. We already have laptops and Google Apps, so I'm not running out to get one. When they finally get a touch-pad out, I hope it works with the Samsung Smart Media Center for their TV's and Blu-Ray players. Just a thought Samsung.
__label__4 Very good desktop replacement system  I decided to purchase a new laptop after my old laptop was taken over by the family for a variety of tasks. I was mostly happy with the system I had, a nice HP Pavilion system with a decent feature set, but considering that it is 2-3 years old and does not run everything I want to run anymore I wanted to make my upgrade to a new system worthwhile. In researching I found this particular system and I pounced on it, as I found it at a steal of a price. It is not perfect, but there is an awful lot in this notebook.  My very first notebook was a Sony Vaio, so I imagined that this would be familiar territory. I was greatly mistaken, as things have changed dramatically since then, mostly for the better.  First off, this is a fast system with lots of expansion room. This is very important to me because I do a little bit of everything - I do some gaming, I write software, I write short stories, I hang out online. I am not considered a power user in that regard so an AlienWare ultra-high-powered expensive gaming rig is not really what I need, but I don't need an entry-level system that is good for little more than checking email either. My needs are for a well-rounded machine that can do most things well. This notebook fits that need.  I am especially impressed with the bright, large screen. I do occasionally toss a movie DVD into the system and treat myself to a private showing of whatever movie I have chosen, and all of that screen real estate makes for an enjoyable experience.  As for DVDs... With Blu-ray built into this system, watching new media movies is not a concern. That's a very nice plus.  I like the fact that this system has two individual hard drives instead of one large one, as I want to create a dual-boot system and not wipe out the whole thing. I was unaware of this when I purchased the system, thinking I had a unified drive, though that was an oversight - the labeling and documentation are clear.  The system comes with 3 GB RAM, expandable to 4. Up to this point things seem to be comfortable in that amount of room.  My first task was to strip off the trial software I don't want or need, which includes MS Office 2007, Webroot SpySweeper and Norton 360. Some people will appreciate these applications but for me they are in the way and clutter the hard drive with unneeded stuff. If these applications were full-release apps with more than 30-90 days of use, I likely would keep them all but in my case I already have licensed software to use that meet the same needs.  The documentation states that there is a firewire port, a VGA port and an S-Video port, and it took searching the web for a manual with technical diagrams to reveal that these are hidden on the right side, under a cover. Nothing that came with the system says where to find those ports, and the cover that conceals these ports blends in well enough to truly hide them - I did not find them without help.  Even more concerning to me is the number and placement of the USB ports. There is one on the back, and two on the right side close to the front edge. I work with an external mouse but I use the built-in keyboard, and I am right-handed. So, if I plug anything at all into those two front edge USB ports, the cords interfere with my mouse use. The solution, then, is to plug a 4-port hub in the back and then plug everything in there.  The built-in speakers are all right, though nothing special. If you want better speakers plug them in and all is well. That said, the built-ins are quite acceptable for most use. You would not want to use them for listening to symphony music, of course, but they're just fine for gaming and general music.  I am very pleased with the graphics. My litmus test for gaming is Neverwinter Nights 1 & 2, and both of these play quite smoothly. I have not loaded up Unreal Tournament 3 yet - that's next - but it should have no difficulty at all with that game.  I did run into one problem that required a call to Sony technical support. Because Sony does not include recovery media with their systems, it is up to the owner to create them and Sony makes it easy with included utilities. There are two options for creating the media - 1 dual-layer DVD or 2 single-layer DVDs. I chose the single dual-layer and after an hour of writing and grinding, the DVD ejected and the system said the creation failed. Assuming it was the target medium, I tried again with the same result. I called Sony thinking I needed to request the recovery DVDs and the technician told me that the single-layer DVD creation would work but that a glitch with this specific model prevents the dual-layer media creation from working. When I used two single-layer DVDs, everything created without a hitch.  This brings up a good point. Some places provide horrible service with operators that no one can understand. I got through in a reasonable amount of time (it was 5am but I still had a brief wait) and I got a very pleasant fellow who was very easy to understand (he did have and accent, though I could not place it) and was very helpful.  This is my desktop replacement system. It does everything I need it to do, it works well and it has a good feature set. It is certainly not perfect, but even at full price it is a good deal for what you get. It is NOT a top-of-the-line gaming rig but it's not marketed as such. If you want a good well-rounded machine, give this one some consideration.
__label__5 Nice  Very nice for money! Hubby uses for work. Will order again in future. Everything works great, look great, very happy!
__label__5 My first Mac experience  Mac! M Loving it!!!!  Boy, this is a super product...One of the lovliest things I have ever used in my life...I was a PC user till I bought this mac..And this is the first time ever that I am using a macintosh computer and I am really happy that I made the right choice. The decision to buy a macbook was made all of a sudden and I do not regret making that decision. From the moment I switched it on for the first time and till this moment, I have been amazed every single day with the ever appealing(& pleasing to eye) features of this OS. It is just so beautiful. I am still trying to learn the Mac OS cos' it's been less than a month since I bought this beauty. The only worry I am having is that some of the other gadgets(Nokia phone & Creative Zen Vision M) that I have do not have compatible software for Mac yet :-(  I am waiting for that day to arrive when these companies release mac compatible S/W. That day, this laptop would have exceeded my expectations by a very large margin...  Here are some of my favourite features in the Macbook:  1. Wow! Beautiful! Gorgeous!  2. The screen resolution is unbelievable! Some of my pictures come to life when I see them through this wonder..  3. The keyboard is intelligently laid out and adds more beauty to the macbook (I like this keyboard better than the one in Pro)  4. The built in camera and microphone are of excellent quality.  5. The two finger feature when using the Trackpad really makes life easy  6. Remote control feature..I use it a lot..Actually I would like to see a few more features added to the Remote in future..  7. Navigation on the dock and files is super fast and slick  I can keep going on and on...cos there are so many things that I like about this..In fact, I have fallen in love with my MacBook ;-)  Things that I would have liked:  1. Few more gigs of hard drive space  2. A good stereo headset supplied in the box, considering the fact that this is a portable/personal product  3. An animated tutorial preloaded in the MacBook to help train switchers get used to the Mac OS interface and basics. I see a lot of stuff on the web, but they are too wordy and time-consuming to read and understand.  4. A more rigid connection between the base and the screen of the laptop(I feel like, I might accidentally break or hurt this link)  Lokesh
__label__5 Excellent!!!!  FAST SHIPPING, LOVE IT
__label__2 Becareful when you do not like this product  I found this deal at [...] Headlinedeals.com and ordered the product on Dec 9th as a gift for my wife. It was delivered a few days later. Unfortunately my wife didn't like the product when it was fully revealed out of the package. It is a bit bulky in a 12.1" size. The LCD with a very wide trim edge compare to my 13.1" PIII6000.  I wanted to return it to Amazon, but only to find it is a product from Tech Depot and I can not return it to Home depot either!  I call Tech Depot for RMA number, only to find the following message from them a few more days later:  We have received your request to return the following product:  Avertec AV 3250H1 Athlon XP-M 12.1 TFT  Please be aware that your request appears to be out of policy for one or more reasons. (Only new, factory sealed product is returnable)  For this reason, the request was submitted to management for an exception approval.  Unfortunately, they were unsuccessful in their attempt.  Reason: RD - Refer Direct. Please Contact Manufacturer-which means that vendor name request that all return be handle through them. Please call 408 294-4336  I will call that number later. Anyway, as a longtime customer at Amazon.com, I wished that Amzon.com had not sell this product on the website with hidden policis.  I would rather spend more money at store at Bestbuy or Circuit City because they have better policy regarding return or refund.
__label__1 Netbook-notbook  We were hoping to make this work, but the speed, capabilities, and ease of use don't make it worth it.  The speed is slow, and opening pages, or having more that one page open makes it even slower.  Not the same as a laptopnot having a CD-rom drive/DVD player is a big loss.
__label__4 Good Deal  Bought as a gift for my father.  He's an intermdiate/advanced level user, so figured he'd give this a good run.  The machine is very lightweight and really delivers.  Very nice display with reasonable battery life. Get another GB of RAM if you can - the weakness with this machine is probably the OS's steep RAM needs - oink, oink!  Liked the Toshiba laptops in 90's, but they sort of dropped in quality (IMO), so I stayed away from them.  This isn't too bad and a real steal for the $$.
__label__5 Sony Vaio  laptop  Hi Sony Vaio Laptop is sleek and easy to use.. Pros: 2 GB RAM and 200 GB harddisk..more than I need Cons: Processor speed is less Laptop is worth for the price I paid..
__label__1 ACER support is almost non-existent  I purchased this laptop on the 13th of last December, as a Christmas gift for my 11 year old daughter.  It ran about an hour before it randomly started freezing and rebooting. I spent a week trying to "fix it", BIOS updates, Windows 7 upgrade, patches, etc.  Trying to get "support" from Acer is a nightmare.  But I did send it back for "repair", by the way if you want to keep the original box don't use it for shipping.  After their repair (replacing its memory) it came back and still rebooted and/or froze ... even while quietly sitting at the prom.  I blame myself for purchasing the Acer, I took a risk that I'd get a working system ... and I lost.  As a computer engineer with 20+ years of experience I find it amazing that this company is still doing business ... it has to have the worst support known to man.  After the failed repair I got a phone number from Google and spoke to a live human to ask for a replacement. I was told that it is Acer's policy to NOT replace merchandise for any reason.  [...]  Really?  Update (Jun 2010)  After sending it back (again), and it's continuing erratic behavior, it was too much.  It was still acting up, and my 12 year old daughter "accidentally" dropped it ... now the screen is cracked.  Can't say it was much of a loss... well except for the money.
__label__5 Great Little Web Surfer  This does everything I wanted it to! I wanted something small I could carry with me and travel for internet purposes and this is perfect! I use it everyday and everything works like a charm! I have only used windows before this Netbook but now that I see how this operating systems works I am not sure why all computer do not use it.  Boots up in seconds and I have never had any problems getting on-line with it. This is a very simple system to use. Everyone who see's it loves it and wants to get one as well.  Perfect travel size, Easy to use, Nice internet connection! Need I say more??  Down falls are: Does not have a lot of ram so to watch a downloaded movie is not smooth and it is very small so you will not get that 15" in screen for viewing, but again I wanted small so works great for me.  Highly Recommended!!
__label__3 Did not include the mouse as indicated on the webpage. Did not disclose that no sound set up for internal output.
__label__3 ASUS Eee PC  Overall the ASUS netbook has been a nice computer. However, the couple of complaints I have are with the battery pack. For example, the adapter that plugs into the laptop looks very frail as though it can/will break easily. Another issue with the batter pack is that the battery blue light stays on even if I disconnect the computer from the battery and leave the battery plugged into the wall outlet. So I must always remember to disconnect the battery pack from the computer and the wall.
__label__3 Great machine except fr the keyboard  At first, I really liked this Acer.  Great display, Win 7 runs well, everything loads quickly, startup is fast.  The keyboard felt a little flimsy, but I figured it was me.  Yet, instead of my typing improving as I got used to it (I'm a pretty good typist) more and more errors appeared: many missed letters, r letters coming in double, just like another user reported.  In less than three weeks of use, the key for Q became stuck, and i had to flip up the flimsy little cover to get at the actual mechanism; eventually that hinged cover came off.  I spent a lot of time setting this macchine up, and to think that I will have to get rid of anything personal, like quickbooks and tax info so that I can get it fixed -- well, let's just say I'm NOT happy!!  Never mind lost productivity because I'll have to go back to my old, slow-as-molasses XP laptop.  I gave it three stars because everything else is great.
__label__2 Great little computer that had display go bad within a week.  I bought this amazing little computer for WiFi Internet use and for storing and playing back videos downloaded through the Amazon.com Unbox software.  The display was great, and it played videos flawlessly; to me a miracle at the price point.  Here I had everything my laptop has only without the DVD drive.  The problem is that the display developed a blue line down the middle that was there all the time.  I researched and found that display problems seem to happen a lot with the Aspire One series of machines.  Since I was within the return window, I deinstalled everything, wiped the data clean, and returned it.  That was a lot of work for very little use.  I'm thankful for the return policy, but not for all the wasted time commissioning and decommissioning this machine.  It takes time to do that correctly.  I think Acer should have tested the display more before putting the machine into production.  That said, I'm very open to buying a future version of this little miracle computer.
__label__4 I was nervous about Vista, not anymore... I like this PC  I'm reviewing A215-S7437 (200GB HD). I noticed the review By William Balsam "Ursus" was for a different model with a smaller HD (160) A good review though.  First of all, as was mentioned by A. B. Davis "brdavis", in an above review. There are some initial issues that need to be addressed. I first powered the unit up I noticed a lot of "crap-ware" (if you Google "cnet crapware" the top hit is a link to a helpful video to rid your PC of crap-ware) this is relatively easy to remove, remember without crap-ware, you pay more for your PC.  As mentioned also above in A. B. Davis's review (I found most helpful, BTW) there is some (he called "artifacts, one pixel deep") weird dimmed lines segmented at the very top of the display about 1" long each, 1mm wide, and about 5 or six of them all across the top of the display, right up at the very upper edge, the furthest right one being brighter than the rest. I knew this was loaded by some program, not sure which one either I went to run>msconfig, (to bring up the run box in Vista hold the start button and press R key). Go to select startup tab, in Windows Vista, all of the Windows's essentials are loaded through "Windows Services" - this means that most of the startup item you see in Vista are completely optional. (For help in identifying items go to [...]) Anyway, that solved that problem, no more lines at the top of the display.  The other problem was loading Roxio 7. I kept getting errors and I kept trying to force feed the install, the battle ensued, I eventually won... ?? I don't know how, I don't know why, I don't really care, it works. There is a DVD burner program on this PC already, I just like Roxio. Other than these little glitches, I like this PC, its sleek looking, sturdy, has all I need, has plenty of speed. The display is quite bright and the resolution much better than my old Gateway MX6025, (the only other laptop I've owned before). Vista is pretty cool, I was skeptical at first, but so far, I like the new platform. It's not so bad. I'll get used to it, so will you.  Looked at a lot of notebook/laptop PC's (would have rather got a Mac, not that rich though) this was the best for the price. It met my needs, actually exceeded them.
__label__1 hate it, terrible customer service, and I'm a Windows expert  I paid about $1500 for this piece of junk, and hate it.  The newest problem is that the microphone doesn't work, and the audio only works at about half the level of the other PCs that I have.  I called Toshiba support about the microphone problem, and their support people from India made me reboot and do other things to waste my time, then said they'd call back, which they haven't done in 6 days now.  Its also full of bloatware (software to try to get you to buy more of their stuff, like their unproven online backup), all of which slows down the machine, or interferes with your standard work.  Don't make the same mistake I did.
__label__4 Toshiba T2330 Laptop  This notebook is cheap and powerful with a T2330 processor. It has a 160 GB hard drive and 2 GB RAM which is remarkable for the price I paid. Toshiba machines have always been heavy and bulky and this one is no exception. Previously I had a 17 inch 12 pound mammoth but its technology was incomparable at the time. Also, only XP Home Edition was included. Vista is better as I detest games. I really like this inexpensive notebook.
__label__3 Product description is incorrect  The notebook does not support Hyper Threading (as given in many sites). I checked the Intel site for this processor and found that it does (or so I thought). Just to confirm, I downloaded Intel Processor Id utility and it reported that the processor does not support HT.    As is the case with most of the branded notebooks, the amount of tweaking that you can do on the system is highly limited. For example, you cannot even change any BIOS settings (except date time/parallel port info and set passwords). None of the advanced chipset features are available. And the BIOS is phoenix bios, which is not supported by most of the BIOS tweak tools that you can run from windows.    The cooling fan does make a lot of noise at times, but I have come to get used to that and unfortunately, you cannot control the fan speed through the power management tool (unlike the case in some other models).    The display is really good with high resolution. I am not into much gaming and all, so the 4X AGP does not make much difference to me.    A couple of things Sony could have improved upon was to put a 333 MHz memory instead of a 266 MHz one and provide a more versatile card reader (the card reader slot supports only Memory Stick Media. So if you want to connect your CF or SD card, you need an external reader.    But having said this much, I am happy with the system and it has not given me any problems so far.
__label__1 MacBook Woes  I purchased my MacBook almost three months ago based on the reviews. My mistake. I admit that I did expect to find the change from Windows to Leopard (Mac OS X 10.5.4) a challenge. What I did NOT expect was that the support personnel at Apple would be so poorly trained that their help was almost useless. The standard solution after 2-3 hours on the phone was to reinstall the operating system. Big mistake. I downloaded Adobe, and it would not work properly on this laptop. I could no longer open simple pdf files. So, I called Apple support. Two hours later I was told to archive and reinstall the operating system. After doing that I still couldn't view pdf files, but finally used spotlight to find that there was still a small adobe file that needed to be deleted. That whole problem should have been a 5 minute phone call.  Unfortunately now  the printer would not work. Two more hours on the phone, and the "support tech" told me to remove the printer and then add it back. Bingo, the printer now worked. But again, more wasted hours. The next day I tried to access the Itunes store. Nope, couldn't do that either anymore. Three more hours on the phone, and I was told that it isn't possible to access the Itunes store from a managed account. Interesting that I have been doing just that for the past three months. Bottom line, don't expect decent support from Apple. If you buy a Macbook, you are really on your own. If you are familiar with Apple computers or have superior technical skills, you should do OK. But if you are coming over from Windows, you will only find frustration and misery. I will attempt to force Apple to take this thing back, and give me a refund. If that fails, I will try to find someone who still thinks that Apple is the greatest thing since sliced bread, and sell this MacBook to them!!!
__label__2 Outdated  Died pretty quick.  Very outdated.
__label__5 Laptop is fine, works ok, Im so happy with this product.
__label__3 Great hardware, not so great software  The great part...hardware-wise, this laptop is top of the line.  Fast Core 2 Duo, 2GB ram, large HDD, 8400M GS, etc.  It has a BEAUTIFUL screen and is insanely light-weight.  Some people do not like the feel of the casing or the keyboard, saying it feels plasticy or cheap, but honestly, I think it feels solid and durable.  The keyboard is the perfect size in my opinion and the casing feels like high quality.  Now comes the not so great part.  Vista! I have never used Vista before but thought that since I'm fairly good with XP, Vista shouldn't be too hard to learn.  Like any new OS you play with, there will be some time spent learning where new features are and how to change this or that.  I'm well aware of that.  Never once did I think this would be an instantaneous transition from XP to Vista.  And actually, it wasn't so much the transition that aggravated me as it was the bugginess of Vista.  I can't say for sure if it is Vista, Sony's software, or a mix, but I had to spend a good chunk of time spread over a week just to get this OS running somewhat stable.  Even at this point, I'm not 100% sure all the kinks are worked out.  I am sure when SP1 comes out for Vista, it will help out tremendously.  So yeah, I'm not sure how to rate this item since on one hand, I love the  design/look and the hardware packed in.  On the other hand, there are definitely some software issues such as Vista and all the bloat-ware installed.  If you're willing to put forth the effort to do any kind of software cleaning, then by the end, you will have one spectacularly running machine.  I got this for a very reasonable price as well from Amazon, so that is another plus to this.  However, if I had bought this a lot earlier when it was $2000+, I would be extremely mad to have to go through so much trouble just to get the laptop to run properly.
__label__1 Be Careful with Your Purchase.  I purchased a Lenovo Y510 2 months ago. It works fine, is very responsive, with good memory, RAM, etc. To my shock, I recently found out that Lenovo does not make a Docking Station for the computer! In fact, they have no idea if they ever will. I spoke to their representatives for nearly an hour and got nowhere, other than stalling. When referred to the Complaint Dept. I got a recording. One would think that a professional (?) mfg. firm would provide ancillary support items!!!!
__label__5 NO MORE BLACK SCREEN OF DEATH  I bought a 215 series laptop from Office Depot a week ago and got the Black Screen of Death an hour into using it. I searching the net I too found the minimum processor fix and haven't had a problem since.
__label__4 good netbook  IT IS A PRETTY GOOD DEAL ON THIS NETBOOK . I GOT THE ONE WITH LINUX . TO ME IT IS FAST ON HOOKING UP TO THE INTERNET. ONLY DOWNFALL IS THE BATTERY. GOT TO TELL YOU WHEN WE GOT OURS MY GIRLS LIKED IT SO MUCH I HAD TO BUY 2 MORE FOR MY GIRLS. SO I GOT 3 NOW. THIS IS BETTER THAN MY GIRLS COMPAQ & FASTER.
__label__2 You Can Get a Better PC For Your $$  The pc condition was just fair. I wouldn't say it's at decent condition. I though I could get a good deal by buying old PC but I was wrong. I got this pc for $201 (after tax and shipping). A week after receiving this product. I notice ads and retail stores having NEW pc with Windows 8 for just $270 to $290. If you are like me trying to buy a decent pc and save $ then just put out a little more and buy a much better pc than these used ones, which looks very used, dirty, and slow.
__label__5 Awesome!!  Small, ultra portable, awesome screen. Hook it to your belt and go. Like everybody else says, the extended battery is a must. I use mine with Sprint's wireless usb card, just like broadband at home.
__label__5 Great Laptop  Great Laptop.  Works better than any windows based Laptop I have had, and it has enough memory to run Windows Boot Camp too!
__label__3 As a Software Developer's Laptop: Power - Win! Heat - Fail! Battery - Fail!  As a Software Developer I was looking for something that was powerful and affordable. I need to be able to fire up a proper dev environment anywhere, without worrying about the pitfalls of laptops one usually gets at this price (they're really underpowered).  This laptop delivers on power. I can run multiple instances of Visual Studio 2010 with Sql Server running full steam, music in the background, office apps all over the place and this thing does not even blink. Incredible stuff.  However, it overheats bad. Real bad. If you're running those eight cores anywhere near their full potential then you are going to know all about it. If it's on your lap, you will want to take it off your lap with 10 minutes or so. If your left hand is near the exhaust where the heat is dispelled, you will want to move it quick-sticks.  Yes, this laptop heats up fast when you put it to good use, and this is unpleasant. Furthermore, when running full steam you don't expect it to go more 90 minutes or so. The battery life is pathetic. So much so that after only 2 weeks of using this pup, my Asus is now for sale.
__label__5 Excellent buy  I love my little asus.  While it will probably never manage to be a workhorse, that's not why I bought it.  It's fabulous for general net surfing and basic office doc uses, works great out of the box and is incredibly portable.  The speakers sound good.  I do wish that getting rid of unwanted/unecessary programs was easier, but they aren't really in the way, especially since adding external memory is so easy and doesn't really cause much slow down.  It's also so *cute*.  Practically everyone who sees it stops to comment on it.  Best computer money I've spent since I bought my original desktop system.
__label__4 IBM THINKPAD T43  1.86GHz 512MG 40GB LAPTOP (REFURBISHED)  I REALLY LIKE THIS COMPUTER. VERY INEXPENSIVE AND DOES AS WELL AS MORE EXPENSIVE COMPUTERS. I HAVE APPLE iMAC COMPUTER AND EVER SINCE I RECEIVED THE IBM THINKPAD 14 INCH NOTEBOOK COMPUTER I USE THIS COMPUTER MORE THAN MY 20 INCH APPLE COMPUTER. IT IS VERY EASY TO USE. I THINK IT WORKS FASTER THAN MY APPLE COMPUTER. THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE IS I CANNOT GET TO WORK WIRELESS,MAYBE IT IS ME. I WOULD SAY THIS COMPUTER IS A VERY GOOD BUY!!
__label__3 Not bad  This is my first and possibly last review. The product overall is built nicely and is "completely aluminum" compared to other products advertised as such (Samsung series 7). I will not discuss the positive aspects of the machine but instead focus on its weaknesses.  =The product I received has some minor aesthetic blemishes. The sides of the laptop are somewhat chipped as well hardly visible scuff-marks possibly a sign of "neglectful handling". Could be numerous variables shipping etc. =The aligning of the lid is off, again minor and hardly noticeable. =The rubber support tabs on the bottom are loose. =Sharp palm rest =Slow hard drive (5400 rpm) installing an ssd can dramatically enhance users experience =Minor flexing on the top of the lid; have not checked the keyboard
__label__1 Looks very nice, but not working.  This looks very nice, but my son hasn't been able to use it because the flash drive is out of date or no good??? Not happy.
__label__5 2g Green Surf  I just recieved my asus eee 2g surf pc today, two days after ordering! I placed my order on the 15th around midnight and it still came today! I was very excited. I met a few problems trying to enable full desktop (im not too keen with linux, but i eventually figured it out by visiting some forums) but other that everything is fabulous! I plan on using the eee for taking notes in classes (im a college student) and for browsing around campus ... if the eee had some kind of day planner installed it would be perfect!
__label__2 keyboard issues  I previously owned an ASUS laptop that I was very happy with. Although the graphics are great on this one, I am disappointed with both the mouse and the keyboard. They are very jumpy and touchy. My friend owns the same laptop and has similar issues. Also ASUS is very, very difficult to work with. Lousy customer support.
__label__1 Very frustrating  I was working with the gentleman that sold me this computer because it would not turn on after about 3-6 months of owning it. Franz was so incredibly helpful and bent over backwards just to get this computer up and running again! It was working for about 2 months from that point and is now no longer turning on again. I have tried contacting Franz twice now and have no gotten a response. After spending about $700 on a used computer this has become SO frustrating. Because now I can not even sell this computer with all my information on the hard drive.
__label__3 It's not perfect...but it's still a Mac  If I had it to do again, I might have gone a different route. I mean, I know this is a refurb, but I can't help being disappointed with the screen defects (brownish spots splashed across the middle of the display). If I didn't need this immediately for my classes (my old laptop died partway through the semester) and they didn't charge a fairly substantial restocking fee, I might have returned this. However, it IS still a Mac and, with a bit of a RAM upgrade, quite capable of handling the new OS X (which, in my opinion, is pretty sweet). Knowing what I know now, I would have spent a little more and gotten something a little newer. It's ok for an older machine...just be aware that it probably will have some irritating defects here and there.
__label__3 Expect what you pay for.  It worked fine for like a couple weeks the started freezing from time to time ik not sure how to fiz that but im not buying apple products online anymore.
__label__4 Just what I wanted  I bought the Asus eee laptop just before going to China for two weeks. I was hoping I could access email and upload photos during our trip but I didn't want to lug a full-size laptop.  It worked perfectly!  This is the perfect travel personal laptop (I wouldn't try to substitute this for a work laptop).  With all the loaded software, we didn't have to do anything except turn it on.  It easily found any wireless networks and connected to them flawlessly.  I was able to upload pictures to our web account and send out emails to friends so they could see the pictures while we were still in China.  I didn't give it 5 stars because of two issues. The first is the small keyboard. It is cramped and often I would hit the wrong key. The "B" key also stuck a bit.  OTOH, my children think the keyboard fits them perfectly. The second issue is that ironically at home the laptop will not always connect to our home wireless network automatically - I have to type in the WEP key.  This started happening when I updated the BIOS. Previously, the computer connected without any problems.
__label__3 Good for the time  I've now had that Lenovo G550 laptop for little over 3 years. I bought it directly from the Lenovo website. I used it only for schooling and as such some features I didn't fully explore (such as the graphics card) Here's what I've found.  THE GOOD:  -Cheap -Windows 7 -User friendly -not a lot of bloatware -Good battery -veri-face software is very secure -multiple usb ports -disc drive -10keys -up to date when first purchased -webcam with easy to use technology -volume control location/mechanics -status light location -manual restart/on and off buttons for certain functions in case keyboard shortcuts failed -durable  NEUTRAL:  -keyboard -location of FN key -screen size -location of power cord/usb ports -screen resolution  THE BAD:  -Heavy/bulky -gets hot quickly -mouse pad often gets in the way of typing due to location -started to slow down after 2.5 yrs -tech support is horrid - phone number on website hard to find as you have to know which category your laptop falls under, I also found the actual support to be lacking and it's outsourced, so good luck understanding them! -number lock turns off after restart/power down -windows 7 showed up as 'non-genuine' in 2nd yr, I bought package with full windows 7 and when I called to get it fixed, they wanted an additional $70 to fix it even though I bought it upon purchase and I had a 3yr warranty -dead pixel 1yr in -easily scratches and shows fingerprints -motherboard fried in under a year-they sent out tech to my home to replace said motherboard, and he arrived almost a week and a half later then I was told -had a default setting of where it would automatically create a backup file...in the hard drive. figured that out 3rd week in when it said I was running out of room...  Considering I used it only for school, it met up to my expectations. Would I buy from Lenovo again? No. The issues I did have with it where enough to scare me off from the product. It now acts slow and clunky, almost as if it contains a massive amount of info, which is doesn't. I'm also starting to have issues with the wifi detector in the computer, and have no desire to deal with that hassle.  I recommend this laptop for a first time user, as it is good as a starter laptop or for someone who doesn't need it to do much or last long. My issues may have been unique, but it doesn't change the fact that I had to contact tech support 2-3 times, and every time it was hassle. At one point I used their chat tech support, I was told to call in and they gave me the phone number to the wrong tech line, I was on the phone to that techy for 2hrs before he realized he what was going on and I was then transferred to wait again and talk again to another tech...no, not worth it.  I give it 3 stars, it worked while I had it and some features where nice, but it kept getting worse the older it got.
__label__1 DONT BUY  Damaged and nonworking computer. NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH THE VENDER
__label__2 Hard to believe  Very disappointed with the configuration of the laptop that I got. On the site configuration says Windows 7 with 2.1GHz Intel Core 2 Duo but it came with Win Xp and processor Pentium Dual-Core. The body is all cheap plastic.
__label__2 UGH!  I bought this computer in August for college..initially, I loved it.  The appearance is perfect; however, the quality is poor.  Approximately two months after purchasing, my screen would randomly turn black and my computer wouldn't turn back on.  After speaking with customer service several times, we finally fixed this problem.  Recently, I took my laptop back to the Geek Squad at Best Buy to tell them about the terribly loud noises that it makes.  They kept my laptop for a week, then said that they heard the "jet engine sound" it was making, but that it was normal.  I'm sorry, but if my roommate can hear my computer roaring from across the room then it shouldn't be normal.  The noises are incredibly annoying and I find it hard to concentrate on what I'm doing...also, I have to restart often.  I definitely would not recommend this computer.  I have had it for 7 months, and have had problems for the past 5.
__label__5 More than a great little gadget  After a little over 24 hours of using this item, I have to say this little gadget is much more than just a fun must-have.  Set-up was quick and easy.  It connected instantly to our corporate network without any input by me.  With our Windows-based units, it normally takes about 10-15 minutes to get everything up and running.  At home, I had it connected to my home network in about 10 minutes, most of that time was spent getting my other computer configured.  I do have a few complaints though and they are minor.  One, it seems to be a little picky about how it connects to the wireless network.  I had to shut it down and restart it several times before it would connect.  After it connected once though, it had no problems.  Two, the windows (tabs) at times are not visible completely - I maximized a window a couple of times and could not scroll to all of the edges and actually had to close out the window (tab).  Setting up my mail was a chore because all of the options at the bottom were not visible, so I just had to hit enter on the keyboard and hope the right button was highlighted.  All-in-all this is a great product.  Aside from the screen size, it is every bit as functional as my work laptop.  Open Office works great with only minor formatting issues.  The keyboard is an acceptable size.  I have the 4G Surf model, which at the time I ordered it Asus only listed one model on their website and that was the 4G model.  I thought I was getting the webcam and the higher capacity battery.  The 4G Surf model does not have those items, but I can purchase them separately.  I successfully downloaded the beta version of Skype for Linux, which includes video conferencing capabilities.  I have not tried it yet, but it looks like it should work.  If you visit some websites, it will tell you that Skype for Linux will have that capability in 2008 - it is available now.  I like this computer for what it is - a lightweight travel companion that I can take anywhere and use anywhere.  For the price I paid, you cannot get a quality laptop that runs this fast and is this practical.  The 900mhz processor and 512mb RAM runs faster than our 1.6ghz Windows-based desktops.  Update: After a little research I learned that you can hold down Alt and left-click anywhere on the window to move it around.  Also, wireless works a lot better now - I have no problems connecting anywhere I go.  The problems I had before must have been a fluke.  The other day I wanted to find certain store, so I parked in front of a restaurant with Wi-Fi and connected to the internet to find where I wanted to go.  What a great deal!
__label__4 Not a bad laptop for general personal use if you install a faster hard drive and install the maximum RAM.  Not bad for an older computer if you max out the memory and use Windows 7.  The hard drives are not particularly speedy but can easily be swapped out for something much faster, which helps with performance.
__label__5 Wonderful idea and many uses  I used amazon warehouse and got this as a refurb. It came in a timely manner and had all the information from manuals to several disks with it packaged nicely. Great price on refurb as well   I was surprised on how well i adapted to it and how it did what i wanted it to do . I was not expecting a full featured system and was pleased with how well it did the internet and how fast it found the wi fi connections in various places. While i in no way could of handled a fancy phone this was perfect for what it does. Very pleased with my Asus Eee Pc 2 g surf and very glad i tried a refurb . Thanks amazon great product and a great price !
__label__5 Quality Computer for Audio Video Chats  Purchased this iBook as a gift for my son who lives 500 miles away.  With Apple's iChat software and this iBook with a built-in camera, we are able to have discussions.  At the same time, we can both access the same web site; with Leopard, we can take control of the other's computer to share ideas and methods.  Since the iBook is portable, he can walk around his house, garage, and yard to share what is going on.  For the money, the weight is decent. If you are looking for a portable computer, with loads of included software, a built-in camera, with a need for email and surfing the net, check out the value of the iBook or the Mac Book.
__label__4 Glad I went bought from Tampa Computers  For an older lap top model this one was fairly light, fast, and a comfortable size for your lap. When you order something used there is always a risk, the battery wouldn't charge when I recieved this one. Tampa computers was prompt in replying. They contacted me the same day, had me try a couple of quick fixes, and when that didn't work took the return without a fuss. They returned the computer to me in perfect working order in less than 10 working days. I would recomend Tampa without hesitation, and the D610 is a nice basic machine too.
__label__2 The computor was slow and iphoto never worked the ac adapter has stopped functionaling, can I have a replacement acx adapter cord?
__label__1 Very bad....sorry!
__label__3 ok
__label__2 Bad Battery, Quality Control issues with seller!  I love Macintosh Computers!!!! The device had slight blemishes..no problem, it is refurbished and to be expected.  My own Macbook Air has significantly more blemishes than this unit.. so no problem.  However what is inexcusable is that the battery in the unit was completely shot !!!!  The battery had a Cycle Count of 1754, and would not hold a charge for more than 30 seconds.  We bought this for our niece who is traveling to Canada and other countries.  We received the unit 2 days prior to her flight, so she had to bring this laptop that would not hold a charge with her.  I have changed Macbook Air laptops for others, but there was no way I could get a $75.00 battery in time before her flight.  The seller has POOR quality control.
__label__2 Tired of Loud Fan Noise!  I have had this laptop for 1.5 years, it is not my first VAIO. I have had no problems whatsoever with my other Vaios, this model is a constant hassle. It makes incredibly loud fan noises, shuts down, or doesn't respond to keyboard commands while it is making the very loud noise. I brought this in to a specialist, they took it apart and could not find any reason for this fan noise. Naturally, while with the specialist, it did not make the noise.  I thought that I would love this lap top, it was quite expensive at the time, but I thought that it would be worth it. After all- my other SONY VAIO laptops were great. Now, I find myself using the older VAIO, it is quiet and does not have the keyboard command issues.  I am sure that other models of the VAIO are great, but do not buy this model.  UPDATE-December 31st, 2010 - I read on the comments that SONY had finally admitted that the fans were defective and was willing to replace them. I called SONY, described the problem and they sent a Tech, person to my house to replace the fan. This all occurred within 1 week. The laptop works great now, no fan noise, no overheating, it is perfect. I certainly wish that SONY would have alerted all of us to this problem to begin with, it would have saved a lot of time. money and aggravation.
__label__3 This laptop has a virus
__label__1 Late 
__label__4 Great Laptop!  The iBook G4 is a GREAT laptop, perfect for-- just about everything. I only didn't like some things in it, like it only having an Apple MINI DVI video out, no PCI slot and it does not have the extensive amount of software that you can use with windows. PROS: Just 5.9 pounds for a 14.1" laptop GREAT design 2 usb 2.0, firewire 802.11g (optional airport extreme card) UP TO 6 HOURS of battery life! That's amazing Combo drive CD-RW & DVD-ROM 40 GB, Speedy processor (933 MHZ) & LOTS more! CONS: does NOT come with bluetooth & airport card (sold optional) no PCI slot :( speakers are small, and are not that loud i can't find another bad thing about it!!
__label__4 review for toshiba sat. 17" widescreen  overall the computer is a great buy. everyone was like who that is a big screen. after a while you get used to it and you love it. and so do they. 2.8 ghz is amazing and the hard drive is the perfect size for any gamer, or business man/woman. the only problem i had and still have is finding a carrying case for it. again it is a great computer for anyone.
__label__4 Solid High-End Machine  I was on the line between choosing a Sony vaio sz120 and sz160. I'm glad I went with the 120. The main differences between the two are the material they are made from -- fibre carbon for the 160 and magnesium alloy for the 120 (ignore the fact that they describe the 120 as black carbon -- this refers to the color only), the weight -- the 160 is about a half pound lighter due to the fiber carbon, and the screen quality. The last thing made me hesitate, as the 160 screen is both thinner, and brighter than the 120s. But the 120 is still pretty darn nice, and for the price difference, it wasn't worth it to me to go with the 160.  Of cosmetic note -- the 160 model has a smooth black exterior, and the word vaio is in black. The 120 has a rough black surface, and the word vaio is in silver. I prefer the rough surface myself, as it is both less prone to scratches and fingerprint smudges.  The machine itself seems fairly solid. The battery is slightly loose, but not too bad. The built in dvd dual layer burner is a very nice new feature for someone whose last laptop didn't even have an internal drive. I was hesitant about the fingerprint reader at first, wondering about whether it was really necessary, what happened if it failed to read your fingerprint properly, etc -- but I am surprisingly taken with the feature. Specifically, the ability to use it to do fast switches between two users on the same system. You can scan multiple fingers, and if you simply can't get it to respond, you fall back to your typed-password.  The webcam, on the other hand, is a waste of space and power. It's incredibly poor quality, and because it's a usb powered camera, it runs afoul of the duo core usb-bug issue that causes your battery to drain faster than it should. Here's hoping they patch that soon.  A heads up on the battery life -- although Sony has scaled back from it's original, preposterous claims of six hour battery life, it's still overestating by a long shot. In speed mode, you'll get somewhere over two hours. In stamina, just over three.  You'll hear Sony taking a lot of grief over the keyboard on this model, and at first, I was also taken aback. I'm used to a keyboard where the keys are raised, and narrow towards the top. The keyboard on this model is almost entirely flat, and as a result the keys take up the entire space allotted to them, and are much larger than what I was used to. People have called these keys "plasticky" and "cheap" feeling, but honestly, I think it's the size that's shocking at first, and people may just be taken aback by the new style. As someone with fairly small hands, it took me about a week to ten days to adjust to the new feel. Now I'm fine with it. For someone with larger fingers, this might actually be an advantage.  My 100 gig drive shows only about 87 gigs. I'm told a good chunk has been set away in a hidden system recovery area. The machine also come pre-loaded to crap they were trying to sell you on. (AOL, Anti-spyware software), etc. I spent the first day or so just cleaning off the clutter.  The wireless seems strong, I haven't tried the bluetooth out yet, and physically, the machine is simply lovely. If you're using stamina mode, and the screen seems to dark at first, use Function+F6 to brighten things up, as going into the display management system just resulted in an overbright, washed out screen.  This may sound like a lot of critical material, but I don't regret buying the machine, and think it will serve me well, hopefully for as long as my last vaio did.
__label__5 Good product  This laptop has everything you can ask for. It is cheaper than similar laptops with the same components but you don't sacrifice value or quality. I would recommend this to anybody from teens for homework or adults for business. You will not be disappointed.
__label__1 the display is dull, I sent mine back and bought a macbook  This product is old tech. the display is dull,I sent mine back and bought a macbook.
__label__5 Simply amazing  This is a wonderful notebook.  The attention to detail is amazing, for example, the keyboard automatically illuminates itself in dimly lit areas.  The single button mouse and trackpad can double as a two button mouse:  place 2 fingers on the trackpad and click the button and it's a right-click.  Place 2 fingers down and slide them up or down scrolls the page.  It has been good for running games.  I have the 128MB video card in mine and seems to handle C&C Generals and Half-Life2 with ease (via my boot camp partition running Windows).  I have even run C&C Generals via a virtual machine, and it was certainly playable (though I had to turn some of the settings down to medium instead of high).  I haven't tried any other games at this point.  No doubt the 256MB model should handle things even better.  Installing Windows via boot camp is a snap, and then installing some virtual machine software allows you have to Windows whenever you need it.  Run it side by side with OS X, or reboot into Windows natively.  The worst part about this notebook is battery power.  With everything turned on and the screen brightness on high, the battery will only last 1.5, maybe 2 hours.  This isn't good for using on plane rides longer that that.  However, I was able to watch 2 movies in a row (approximately 4 hours) and still have some life left.  I accomplished this by ripping the movies to my hard drive (doing so saves power since it doesn't have to spin a DVD in the drive constantly during playback), disabling the wireless card, and lowering the brightness as low as possible.  Unfortunately I can't seem to control screen brightness when booting directly to Windows, so the battery life is much worse when running Windows.  Apple just released a battery update in early October 2007.  It appears the battery life is better (I can now get about 3.5 hours with the brightness at about 50-60% when simply checking email, browsing the web etc.).  I'm very pleased with that update!  There is very little learning curve if this is your first time using a Mac.  It's rock solid (in fact, the only application that seems to crash on me is MS Office), and rarely requires software updates (unlike Windows).  Though not many viruses affect Macs, some still do and there is anti-virus software available for Macs.  If you're considering this but not sure, just take the plunge.  You won't be disappointed.
__label__1 Watch Out for Power Plug  Toshiba laptops have a big time power plug issue (internal power jack pulls away from housing preventing plug insertion). Mine failed within 4 months of use. It is a obvious design problem which Toshiba continues to ignore. Type in Toshiba Laptop Problems in Yahoo search engine. Its a problem that will NOT go away. Too bad...besides this issue it's not a bad machine. Customer support is way bad!!!
__label__2 I contacted customer support and the man who helped me was very nice and articulate  I purchased this item because I needed an inexpensive laptop to get me through work while I had my regular computer repaired. I didn't heed the reviews I read because I don't do much with the computer so I didn't think it would be hard for the computer to meet my needs. Unfortunately I was wrong. This laptop was slow as others had mentioned, but that didn't really bother me. However the screen would grey out and become unfocused to the point of not being readable. I contacted customer support and the man who helped me was very nice and articulate. However after more than an hour of valuable time on the phone, this laptop still has the same problem. I wasn't streaming videos or gaming, simply accessing the cloud for work-related tasks, so if that's all you need, this product isn't for you.
__label__4 Apple MacBook  I really like this computer. I paid a reasonable price for it and ALMOST everything is in working order. The only complaint I have is the disk player; it does not work which is a little annoying (the only reason it did not get 5 stars). It is an older model so I have to do some updates, but nothing to serious.
__label__3 Satisfactory but only one USB port  The computer was OK but had only one USB port which was loose and needed to be tightened before it worked. Only one USB port is not a misrepresentation -- but I would think I could assume that one could expect more than one port on a computer like this!
__label__5 Once you go Mac you won't go Back  I use my laptop to for my music, photo album, investing analysis, communications. I have a new company provided IBM laptop. I don't use it unless if I can avoid it. Its not just the hardware, Apple has got the only operating system that makes sense.
__label__5 Just perfect !  I had been reluctant to adapt to notebook PCs due to the small keyboards and most laptops/notebooks are not really either small nor light.  I bought mine as if by love at first sight, beautifull siver, 1" thick and 4.5 lbs in weight, it stood out on the shelf.  The Averatec is fast enough so that you really won't miss ultra fast processing (wouldn't make sense to expect workstation or gamestation ultra speed in a notebook for the road) I would think.  It's a problem of definition, for me a "portable PC" is just what Averatec packages in the 3270, the best performance you can get economically.  With a 60/80 Gb HD, DVD burner, wireless card, SMALL and LIGHT frame, 2.5 hour battery, great screen, 512 Mb memory...  I watch DVD's, browse, work with Photoshop, listen to music and get asked frequently "what PC is that... for how much..?  It does perfectly well all that is not "extreme", but then again, how much extreme do you need..?  Makes me feel great.  I dumped my Toshiba Satellite and wouldn't pay 2000 bucks for a replacement, I tell you.  But got mine for $900.00 and got a $150 bucks rebate.  Need to have the fastestes or most expensive..? Don't look here.  Need a PORTABLE PC...?  Get an Averatec !
__label__1 Bad Company to Purchase From  They sent me the laptop with the BIOS password set and it had a burned out cpu fan.... not easy to replace. I emailed them to let them know and they didn't care that I had a bad experience. Would not buy from this seller again.
__label__5 Best Computer System Ever Used!  I am not going to bore you with all the tech details the 15.2" Powerbook with Superdrive comes with, but I do want to let you know that I usually buy a new computer every year. They have all been PC's, but I got sick and tired of crashes and that dreaded "end program now" prompting from Windows Xp. This would happen with any program that used alot of RAM such as photoshop etc. Using two heavy duty programs or multi-tasking was impossible with Xp. Now with this beautiful Mac, no crashes, rock stable performance. I can run multiple screened programs effortlessly on the fly. The panther OSX system is rock stable. The computer is beautiful looking, it comes with some of the best software I have ever seen in a laptop. Steve Jobs has made me a believer! I will never go back to owning just a PC. And the beauty of it all is that you can now share files with almost any Windows file format doing away with old compatibility problems. This computer is fast and does not stick. It is light, and looks very sleek. Nothing can beat that!
__label__3 Great Value But Few Minor Imperfections  Overall the Sony FE880EH is a great value for the futures being offered. There are a few minor imperfections about this laptop, but I highly recommend. The features that you get with this laptop is of good value.  PROS:  1. The monitor is excellent and even bright enough when I am in the office or outside. By far, Sony's screens are the best.  2. Hard drive and RAM are large enoughto run several programs and to run Windows Vista.  3. The design and look is simple and elegant.  4. Price is great especially with the value you're getting.  NEUTRAL:  1. Sound is not the best, but it works fine.  CONS:  1. There are no bootable CD's and detailed manuals that came with the notebook. All can be found on the internet.  2. Windows Vista tends to slow down when you click the Start Button > All Programs. There is a delay when you scroll through all of the applications. I would notice that the hard drive would be intensively working minutes after the computer was booted up.  3. Windows Media Player has about 3-4 second delay before playing any .mp3 music with this notebook.  4. The battery's life is very short. It lasts about 1.5 - 2 hours under normal usage.  5. The power supply is short.  6. The positioning of the USB should be on the back not all on the sides.
__label__3 just a comment on battery life  I just bought this computer new and wanted to comment on the battery life of this computer since it really disappointed me. It says up to 5.5 hours but in never exceeds 2 hours even without wireless. I advice Amazon.com to correct their description in order not to mislead people. Thanks
__label__4 computer works well  The computer is well working a little bit slower than my others but it works well and can't complain!!!
__label__1 Beware! CTL makes garbage computers!  I'm a quasi-administrator for a huge, notoriously cheap organization that is always doing incredibly stupid stuff to save money. One of their dumbest maneuvers a couple of years ago was to purchase CTL computers, both desk and laptop varieties, for everyone. They are junk! They crash with impunity. They lock up, and they are slow. Just last month, my office-mate had to return three different CTL laptops to the seriously over-burdened IT department because they simply would not boot up after the initial two or three uses.  Personally, I haven't tried one of these little 9" units, but in view of the bad experiences I and so many others of my fellow employees have had with CTL crap, why on earth would I consider paying for one? Besides, I suspect 512MB RAM might just be a tad annoying. Spend a little extra money and buy a decent machine! If not, be sure to back up your files every time you use it.
__label__5 Great  The main reason I bought this computer was that IT IS NOT WINDOWS!!!  This is not just because I am a Apple person, just recently Intel gave Microsoft the finger by saying it would not upgrade it's 80,000 company computers to Vista, because windows is old, slow junk. Five minutes after I opened the box I was up and running, connected to my wireless internet. Same thing at work. The desk top has big icons and is very clear;internet,work,learn,play,settings,favorites--simple and easy. A great value for [..]
__label__5 Great computer  Data sales co. is great.  They are very helpful and sell quality computers.  They are wiling to answer your questions if you will e-mail them.  The computer was received in new condition.  Everything worked well.  I am very pleased with this purchase. I did upgrade the memory and replaced the hard drive although they were in good working order.  The 2668 is capable of running video for presenations with a good video output with memory.  It is a very nice computer.  Light and easy to use. Getting ready to upgrade to Windows 7!
__label__2 Less than thrilled. Programs galore.  Well, when I first got the laptop, I was going to return it. The key press is very soft. You have to press really hard for the typing to show up. Quite annoying. But then the whole hassle of returning computers got to me. So I kept it. Shouldn't have.  I got this laptop less than a year an half ago, thinking It's a SONY, famous for quality. And it seemed to be well built. I changed my desktop picture recently from a bright colored bottom to a picture with dark and light color combination, and I realized that the screen is actually vibrating in the middle when I type! It also moved when i just move the laptop slightly.  The frame along the bottom of the screen on the right has also started to separate slightly from the LCD screen itself! It's not somewhere I could have broken myself, so I can only imagine that it is the poor quality of the laptop.  Other faults? .  The fan has been extremely noisy when the laptop warms up/boots up. .  It cannot handle heavily graphical games. It gets really really hot near the CPU and fan. .  The VAIO care program seemed to have crashed itself somehow and cannot be fixed (not that I care about that really but the pop-up screen about the failure keeps showing back up every couple of days. Very annoying.)
__label__2 Disappointed  I had some problems with this laptop during my one year warranty that  Apple refused to fix!  I loved the computer's look and functionality, but I was disappointed in the company policy.  If you buy a new or refurbished apple product, you better make sure you purchase the additional Apple Care or you might find yourself screwed!
__label__2 Good Looking Computer But Poorly Engineered  Pros: Cool looking exterior. Top of the line video card.  Cons: Overpriced. Easily overheats. Sub par components. Poorly engineered on the inside.  I have owned four Alienware computers, including three laptops and one desktop computer. I was severely disappointed with all of them. My first two laptops all died within one year. And, my last two were replacement computers given to me by Alienware and lasted no more than two years. They have a bunch of power under the hood and therefore have a short shelf life. Although Alienware computers look really cool on the outside, it's what's on the inside that is horrendous. With exception to the graphics card, the rest of the components are poor quality. And, the engineers at Alienware did a poor job in constructing the computers. Placing the hard drive next to an overheating video card is not smart engineering. Furthermore, screws were missing on the inside and the casing is typically made out of cheap plastic. I highly recommend to stay away from Alienware and consider other high-end gaming computer brands.
__label__5 Customer Service at it's finest  Thank you for working with me to resolve the issue with warranty for this computer. I cannot wait for it to arrive and my son sees it. Im sure he will be very happy and satisfied with the quality and condition of this computer.  I cannot tell you how refreshing it is to have a Seller that responds to every question with care, professionalism, understanding, and a will to put the customer first. I congratulate you on having employee like Jason that represents your company in that way. When I ready to buy another computer you can bet you last dollar there will not be a question on which company I have the FAITH in
__label__5 Almost perfect  I rushed into buying this because I saw an offer of free Parallells and a free carry case, I'm glad that I bought it. I discoverd how well iMovie works with my Digital Camcorder and now I have plenty of time to practice using them together.  The only significant problem I have is using a trackpad instead of a mouse but that's a laptop, not a macintosh, problem.
__label__4 I love this computer  I love this computer . but only had an issue with it . that it came with a wobbly screen. So I had to have the hinge tightened . and it had quiet a feaw dents but other than that it works perfectly.
__label__5 Allow me to dispel some complaints...  First off, what I like about this computer. I have been very impressed with this computer. A friend taught me a bit about Macs and helped convince me to buy it. Some features I really like are the built-in camera and microphone, the accelerometer, remote control, the magnetic screen closing as well as the magnetic power cord connection (very easy to use). The included software is excellent as well.  I was a little hesitant in buying a Mac because I like gaming. But I learned that the Mac comes with the ability to make a hard drive partition for Windows, and the drivers to make sure that Windows recognizes all the hardware and makes it function properly. A couple of games haven't worked properly, I don't know why, but overall I have been very satisfied with this. Mac computers offer you the best of both worlds now.  Another reason I like this computer, was made obvious at home.  I am a college student, and at home my parents have a Windows desktop. On one occasion their printer stopped working with their computer. My mom uninstalled the printer, reinstalled it and its drivers, and it still wouldn't work properly. But I hooked up the printer to my MacBook and it was immediately recognized and completely functional.  Genuine Plug-and-Play.  I printed my mom's document, and meanwhile her computer still won't work with that printer (though it used to).  Now to dispel some complaints about this computer, or Macs in general:  Some reviews have complained about the difficulty of right-clicking with the trackpad.  Truth is, the secondary click is EASIER THAN WITH A PC.  In the System Preferences you can enable secondary clicks with two fingers on the trackpad.  Just touch your two fingers to the pad and press the button, that's a right-click. Easy.  Personally I use my middle finger for moving the mouse, adding my ring finger to scroll up and down, and to right-click, with my index finger wherever I want it on the button. It's comfortable and simple.  And if anyone complains about the lack of a Home, End, Pg Up or Pg Dn buttons, all you have to do is press Command + (arrow).  And to delete text from the right of the cursor, it's Fn + Delete.  I also saw a complaint about the difficulty of seeing which applications are open.  Indeed, some applications do not completely close when you press the red button in the corner. When you want to see what's still running, hold down Command and press Tab. You will be shown the logos of each running application. Highlight any of these applications with the mouse and press Q to quit them. Alternatively, when an application window is still open, you can just press Command + Q to completely exit the program.  I hope I have been of assistance. I have found that this computer is really easy to use, and has great hardware and software features. All you need to do is familiarize yourself a little. You won't be disappointed.
__label__5 This lap top has accompanied me to Afghanistan and back without any breakdowns or data base failure.  This is truly a strong device.
__label__3 Good Laptop but poor sound with the speakers  Generally speaking this laptop offers great quality in all the features you can think a regular laptop would offer Great conectivity to internet,great screen resolution nothing to complain about HOWEVER THE BIG PROBLEM OF THIS COMPUTER IS THE SOUND ON THE SPEAKERS ...IT IS VERY LOW.....I compare the sound on the speakers in my laptop with my wife's which is a DELL Laptop and hers clearly sounds way better.  I called Toshiba customer service and they said that is the highest volume that the speakers have CRAZY HUH? they said they do not have any sort of update to improve the speakers performance ....the only way to fix that would be by sending my laptop to their repair center...NO WAY ...I am currently living in Costa Rica and I will not send this computer back it would take forever to receive it again with the same issue NO WORTH AT ALL.
__label__4 Superb Graphics & Physique  First chief feature of HP z7010us is the extreme graphics it produces. With 64MB shared video memory in collaboration with Nvidia GeForce Graphics Card, you can play the toughest games easily such as "Need For Speed Hot Pursuit 2" or "Max Payne 2" or "Medal of Honor". All in 17" Fullscren. So for boys and girls who like playing heavy-duty games this computer is desirable. Second main feature, as I see it, is the computers Physique. Even though it is a dense computer, the way it is constructed, makes it look sleek and slim. It really looks very smooth, and the silver & shiny color makes it look majestic. For people who give a heck to the shapes of laptop's this computer looks good. As to speed of this computer, "Intel Pentium 4 2.66 Ghz" AND "512MB-RAM" will never fail fail you. Run one task and you will get lightning-fast performance. Run two tasks at a time, and still get a good performance. Of course we have A DVD-ROM and CD-RW for watching movies and burning CD's. One thing that I didn't like about this computer is the time it takes to load fully. When I log in to Windows XP, it takes 1 minute for the computer to load completely. And the more programs you install the more time it will take to load. Previous computer I owned, much slower then this one, took at most 30 seconds to load fully. One last feature of this computer is it's keyboard. The Hp zd7010us has a numeric keypad to the right of the normal keyboard, so it is easy to enter numbers. People who are interested in a 17" Widescreen laptop's must give this computer a try. You can always exchange!
__label__4 try to read this  This low price macbook is fast on internet but i couldn't download anything on the webb, but i could download on the app store i looked on youtube to see if there was a way but no video for this mac book, this is a really old mac book, i tryed to sell it in the pwn shop but they wouldn't take it because it's under 2 years ( it was made in 2006 ... it's 2014 almost 2015 ) but other wise its really good....the macbook is great  if you love shoping on line or being online (online job ) good on face book good for newbies you might can download on the webb but you might have to upgrade (i hate wasten money on something old ... like my x girl friend ) or ask somebody, if you really want a low price 2006 macbook ill sell minds for $250 or $ 150 i really don't want it, i want a alien wear lap top or a xps lap top something in dell inc. So my pc can upgrade so i don't have to buy another laptop.( my email is : bobbydizzle1234@gmail.com ask about that lap top if i sell it, no money back because i have bought something with your cash and im young to get a good job ) if you need information i might have it i might!!!!!
__label__1 The computer does not hold charge.
__label__3 Good support from Dell  I purchased this to replace my old XP laptop, primarily because XP will lose all support shortly. I chose it because of excellent expert reviews for this computer found on the Web. My remarks here are limited by my lack of personal knowledge of competing Windows 7 laptops and newer laptops in general. I was disappointed by the changed aspect ratio (greater screen width compared to the height) but I suspect that's standard in newer computers.  Since my purchase was of a used computer I was not surprised that the battery was apparently not operative. I say "apparently" as I have no interest in running the computer on battery (I use the machine as a desktop). However, the bright battery charging light was constantly flashing, and this was exceedingly annoying. I *was* surprised--unpleasantly so--to find that the battery is built into the computer. That is, removing the battery leaves a hole on the back of the computer for which no cover is available. (One must either replace the battery or leave the hole.) This affects the machine's balance and stability on the desk or table.  On the plus side, Dell offers 24/7 phone support even though I bought the computer used.  UPDATE. The good folks at Tampa-Laptops (the Amazon merchant from which I bought this product) offered to send me a replacement battery free--until they realized it was beyond the 30-day warranty period. They've persuaded me nevertheless to purchase a battery, not only for my reasons stated above but because that would stand me in good stead in a power outage. I can get it at Amazon for about $14 (with free shipping for a $35 purchase). Tampa-Laptops provides helpful technical support, but to get it you might have to bypass the phone extension for technical support and instead connect to customer service.
__label__2 Don`t worth it  I bought this computer thinking that I could do the most things I used to do on anyother computer with chrome and internet, But it`s not true, chromeOS can`t do many things that any other OS can do, like runing videos and moveis, listen music or even text editing. Like a early adopter user, would be nice if it was cheaper than it is, US$ 500 on a computer that can not be used like "real computer''  is not a good deal.
__label__3 These are good for the price  These are good for the price, but the obly problem is the batterys. Owners before may have been rough on a lot of these batteries. Battery dies quick.
__label__5 Best consumer level laptop!  The Macbook does it all.  I can burn DVDs/CDs.  It has garageband, itunes, imovie, iphoto.  It does everything a consumer laptop should do.  AND EVERYTHING JUST WORKS!!  That is the best thing about the Mac.  It works....there are no blue screens of death, no conflicts......  The Leopard operating system is far ahead of Vista.  In fact, you'll find that many windows users are downgrading back to XP.  Do yourself a favor and get a Mac....get this Macbook and you'll never go back to windows.
__label__5 law school life-saver  After spending the first two years of law school lugging around an incredibly heavy (~8 lb.) laptop and too many ridiculously heavy case books, I started looking for a lighter alternative. I stumbled upon the Averatec and tried it because I was impressed by the specs and the price. I could buy three Averatecs for the price of one Sony Vaio.  I LOVE this computer. It is light and the perfect size to tuck into any briefcase or bag. I have gotten as much as 4 hours from a fully charged battery, and have gone two days without plugging it back in by putting it in sleep mode.  It does have some drawbacks. The speakers are pretty bad, but since I only use them to play "Sugar, Sugar" by the Archies for my daughter, I can live with them. Lectures and tutorials sound fine on them.  It also does get pretty hot, but my techno-nerd husband has instilled in me the habit of always setting my notebook on a book or wooden tray (never directly on my lap or a pillow), so the fan can work pretty efficiently. I have never burned myself on this computer.  There are a few rub marks on the inside plastic around the screen, but they are really easy to remove with a pencil eraser.  I am thrilled with my purchase and have used it every day for nearly a year. It is exactly what I wanted and cost much less than I expected. I plan to continue using it when I practice, perhaps with a universal docking station. I LOVE this computer!
__label__3 Nice specs...poor performance...  Shipment was not an issue it arrived within the time frame promised.  Like the aesthetics of the laptop despite its annoying flaws. Such as:  Audio problems, sometimes would cut out especially between logging in and out, which is one of the most annoying problems I'm experiencing.  Scroll on mouse pad buggy & scroll bar is dysfunctional.  Full of bloat ware from hp which slows it down considerably to the point that one who didn't know it wouldn't believe that there are two 2.4Ghz processors running the machine, but was a minor problem easily remedied.
__label__1 awful packaging and awful for returning  To this date I have not received a single email from this company acknowledging mine. In order to return the item I need an authorization code and I have requested this on three emails. Not one single email has been received in return to me, telling me how to go about returning the item and receiving my money back
__label__3 Terrible Battery Life  & Clicking Sound  This is the 2nd review I had on this laptop the battery doesn't stay charged for even 5 minutes which to me is wrong & I feel battery should be replaced for free. Also the laptop clicks all the time & I'm afraid it's going to crash on me. I cannot find a place to put my memory card from camera, maybe it doesn't have it. Other than these things I love my laptop. Thanks, Allison Pitts
__label__3 Hate it.  This computer looks very modern, & sleek.  However I'm really starting to think the thing is junk, I wish I would have bought some other brand, like HP, or Compaq I've had 3 laptops before this 1 and they actually worked good.  The battery life on this computer sucks.  It's not good for playing games on cause everything moves to slow, I even updated my Fash player, & it still didn't help.  Also the thing has already stopped working, I'm going to have to call tech. support, to see what's wrong with the dumb thing, It comes up to a black screen when I turn it on, & gets no further than that.  What was I thinking when I bought this computer.
__label__2 It's ok...  When the computer got here I was expecting a good conidiophores computer... The computer had many deep scratches on the back and has a chip and is missing part of it by the mouse. But it is fast
__label__1 Toshiba has manufacturing problems  I purchased two Toshiba Satellite computers and one Qosmio G15R computer. Within a short period of time, the electrical connection on both Satellite laptops had broken and we were advised the repair cost was higher than the cost of a new computer. The Qosmio G15R was built with a defective motherboard. Within a few months I had  vertical lines on the screen. I brought it to an authorized Toshiba repair center. A month later I received it back and it seemed to work. A year later, again lines. This time I sent it to Toshiba and they replaced the motherboard.  Another year, lines again. This time Toshiba told me the computer was out of warranty so it was my problem. When I insisted it was a manufacturer defect, the Toshiba technical supervisor yelled at me on the phone that it was not a manufacturing defect. If you want these kinds of problems, buy Toshiba. I'll never purchase any Toshiba product ever again, and I'm going to warn my friends not to as well. Wallace Reid.
__label__5 Great little laptop despite its age  Great little laptop despite its age. toss in 4gb ram (3 usable) an ssd, and 10.7.5. and you got a zippy little machine. Very happy.  On the downside it arrived with a dead battery, but found one cheap enough
__label__2 Big disaster  I just received this item, yesterday, and after anxiously awaiting its arrival...I wish I had saved my money and put it on a better laptop. I know you get what you pay for but I would've tolerated almost any other minor problem but the screen being messed up. From the time I took it out of the box to just now, the screen would show all these lines up and down it unless you pressed down on it with your thumb. As soon as you removed your thumb, it would do the same thing, making it impossible for you to type or move the cursor. The only time I could type is when I held the corner of the screen with my thumb, which is ridiculous! I am planning to contact the seller on Monday and see if I can arrange to ship this "thing"back to them and get a refund. I would accept a laptop in much better shape in exchange for this one but I don't trust that they will send one any better.
__label__1 Wireless stop working  Wireless stop working. Chatting online with HP, he said it will cost about $300 if warranty is expired. HP has not recalled for this model but others of HP pavillion some has been recalled. Wish more people have the same problem on this model and we can issue this to HP.
__label__4 Asus Eee PC 2G Surf  The Asus is a sweet little second computer that allows one to Google answers when watching TV or type (if you have small hands) reports anywhere.  However, when I first opened mine it would not work with my AirPort Extreme.  When I called for support, the first two support persons had suggestions that were way off, and didn't make any sense.  The third spent 20 minutes with me, deleting, reimporting, connecting and deconnecting until I could access the web at home.  About a week later when I turned on the computer, I could not access the web again.  I called and I got a Chinese person with limited English who, after one computer move (i.e. accessing "Network") literally screamed at me for an answer to how many things were listed under "Type".  I mean, screamed and screamed.  I visualized him standing on the desk and jumping up and down.  When I asked if I could talk with someone else, he said "No, call back tomorrow."  I did.  The person didn't know what to do, and I finally figured it out myself.  It just shouldn't be that hard.
__label__1 Hardly works  This was a total waste of money . . . I don't even know why I bought a dell because I've owned two others and they weren't any good either . ..
__label__2 Hard Drive Failed After 14 days.  Bought the computer on my trip to Honolulu Hawaii on Oct. 21. On a business trip to Japan, the hard drive failed and could not get it fixed at Sony Dealers in Japan. Was told that must send to San Diego, CA to get fixed. Recent quotation is $700 plus. Never buy Sony made in China. Will never buy Sony...period.
__label__3 This machine is loaded with terrific features. It boots incredibly fast, the display is amazing, and the keyboard response is wonderful.  The touchpad did take some getting used to, but wasn't a big deal.  However, I cannot recommend this device for one reason:  the blasted power cord doesn't attach firmly to the laptop. When I pick up the laptop, it falls out.  When I move the laptop, it falls out.  When I close the lid, it falls out.  Sometimes it just falls out for no apparent reason.  Worse, sometimes it doesn't fall all the way out, but it just kind of hangs there, not charging the battery. This is especially annoying, since there are no indicators that the machine is charging when the lid is closed.  Thus, I have closed the lid, the power cord has jiggled and disconnected, and the next morning my laptop isn't fully charged.  This is incredibly bad design in a machine that is otherwise superb.  <UPDATE> About 3 weeks ago, I started having the wireless problem other users have noted.  I went to the online help provided by Samsung to report both the wireless problem and the problem with the cord.  I spent a frustrating hour there, with instructions like, "plug the cord FIRMLY into the machine."  Annoyed, and not expecting much, I called the 1-800 number for service the next day during business hours.  I am pleased to report that this worked out extraordinarily well.  The person on the phone line was helpful, courteous, and prompt.  Within 15 minutes I had a return authorization for both problems.  Ten days later, I have my machine back.  Both problems are fixed.  The cord no longer falls out, and the wireless is impeccable.  I'm now again delighted with my laptop.  My only reservation is with the build quality; I've owned 8-9 laptops previously, and this is the first time I've had to send a new machine in for service.  This is a great machine, now that it's working...but for over  $1000, shouldn't it have worked in the first place?
__label__1 Terrible Design  Toshiba's A205-S5804 is one of the worst put together laptops I've seen, and as a PC repair technician I've seen quite a few. There are only 2 USB ports on the left side of the machine - which means you need a long USB mouse cord to loop around the back of the machine (for right handed people).  The USB ports are extremely close together and parallel to each other, so any devices you have MUST have an extension cord. Large flash drives, MP3 players, and USB modems will block the 2nd USB port. You must purchase USB extension cords and/or a USB hub. This is extremely frustrating to anyone using Vista's readyboost feature, which allows a flash drive to be used as extra virtual memory.  An Express Card slot allows you to slide a card into the machine, the only problem is that there IS NO Express Card hardware. It is amazingly frustrating to spend 20 minutes trying to line up pins for a device that does not exist.  Preinstalled software includes a gigantic program for controlling Bluetooth (a wireless device like WiFi mostly for printers and phones). This might lead someone to believe that Bluetooth is built into the machine... it isn't. Massive amounts of RAM are devoted to running software controllers for hardware that does not exist.  Also preinstalled are (1) Games you can play only once before having to pay Toshiba to play again (2) Resource hogging anti-virus software that expires in 30 days before demanding hundreds of dollars to keep using it (3) MS Office suite with 30 day expiration  All in all, a badly put together machine. For the same price you can get a refurbished Dell Inspiron with a faster processor, three times the RAM, double the hard drive space, and an integrated 2 mega pixel webcam. HP also makes excellent machines, both refurbished and new. Avoid Toshiba.
__label__4 Wish it came with the faster hard drive.  I am very happy with this Toshiba laptop but I wish it came with the faster hard drive. The 5400 rpm drive is plenty fast enough for our use but for the price I would have liked a 7200 drive.  It gets fairly rough use by several people at our international folk dances. Our Mit_Player Database of 2500 MP3 songs is accessed by our dancers who pick the folk song they need and then play it out of the Toshiba into our amp and speakers.  The small 4 pound weight makes it easier for us to take home for security and where we make updates to the database. It will also be taken to dance events in other states and Canada.
__label__3 Lightweight, long battery life, but very, very slow...  This notebook is the right price for those wanting high portability and long battery life.  It's not a workhorse though and the low entry price is quickly explained as users experience the notebook's regular lethargy.  There's enough power to run email, antivirus and some browsing.  Beyond that, it will come to a creeping halt.  Summary, if you are seeking the portability and dependable battery life and don't plan to do graphics design or other processor-intensive (or even disk-intensive) work, I would highly recommend this machine.  Otherwise, spend the extra several hundred dollars to get a similar system with some muscle!  You'll thank yourself later as it's worth the frustration reduction.
__label__4 Good looking laptop but a very slow one.  Vista is worse than terrible. The laptop is great but even with 3gig ram runs a little bit slow for me. The features are great and the tablet pc even better. However, I don't like it. I mean,the laptop is great but I had the Hp Pavilon special edition and it was running faster than this one with just 2 gig of ram and 1.6(with xp). It also makes very noise and it gets hot very easy. I bought this laptop couse the size is great and its very portable. However, thats the only good think that this laptop has, its portable and is a good tablet pc...nothing more.
__label__5 Best computer product I have purchased in recent times  This notebook has it all, does it all and I* could not be happier. The Premium Vista opoerating system was not as difficult as I had thought it would be. I could use less prompting reminders however to make a good operating system better. I think the design is beautiful and would recommend HP and it's support to anyone. Amazon.com has been terrific in every way from purchase selection to delivery, many thanks to them.
__label__2 Screen Way Too Small  This is a nice first attempt and try. Unfortunately the screen is way too small and the case too cheap looking.  I tried it and sent it back.  I am waiting for the new versions coming out soon with larger screens and more features and style.
__label__5 Always satisfied with Sony products  I just want to touch some subjects that have been the negative points of the other reviews. Battery IS a little bit loose, however I don't think it's to the point that you need to worry about it. It has a locking mechanism to secure the battery to the main unit. I actually like the keyboard better than my old Sony notebook (K-series). It's light and bigger. So, contrary to the complaints in the other reviews, I actually think the keyboard is an improvement. The notebook does come with the options of "Stamina" and "Speed" performance. So, you can easily choose "Stamina" if you are running on your battery, and switch to "Speed" otherwise. Therefore, you DO have the options to have longer battery support. I had problem setting up my wireless connection in the beginning, and I actually had to call Linksys to get support and received tips from the technical support person. Apparently, Sony has its own wireless connection manager. So, when I just enabled this manager (and disabled windows wireless connection manager), everything runs smoothly. Go to "VAIO Support Central" in the start menu for information. I wish Sony provided at least some hints about this. But all is well now. Other than those issues, I love this notebook!! It's light (way lighter than the K-series, so I don't have to worry about back/shoulder pain from carrying it everywhere I go). I was afraid that the screen would be too small for me, but it turned out to be okay. The AC adapter (again comparing it with the K-series) is definitely a lot smaller and lighter. I have yet to explore the (integrated) web cam feature, but I am pretty excited about it. If you are a Sony notebook fan, you can't go wrong with this product.
__label__1 I recieved this laptop dirty with lots of tape and marks on it  I recieved this laptop dirty with lots of tape and marks on it. A dead battery as well. I had to spend about an hour trying to get the dirt and tape off with nail polish.
__label__2 Good notebook but horrible support from Sony  This notebook would receive a full 5 stars because of the features and thiness, but sadly because of the horrible support Sony and all the bloatware it comes with I will only rate it a 2. Also this is my second notebook I bought from Amazon because the first one was defective. Sony customer support wanted me to pay $99.99 for repair which is absolutely ridiculous. ALSO my current one has issues so I'm sending it in for repair after complaining about the $99.99 which they're not charging me for now. Horrible customer service, outsourcing calls, and no recovery CD really made this experience a nightmare. I'm keeping the laptop but think twice before purchasing the this SZ series. Go with a Dell M1330. Heavier and bulkier, but you won't have to go through what I did with Sony.
__label__4 Nice small laptop  Pros: size factor, RAM and HDD size, fingerprint reader, sound quality  Cons: heat, heat, heat, AMD processor  Overall, good buy for the money
__label__2 Horrible.  Bought this not 2 weeks ago and the battery failed, among other things. I am a student and don't have time to go tinkering around trying to fix it so I am sending it back.  Pros: Looks nice, keyboard is okay  Cons: It is loud even when I have just turned it on. Sometimes it takes a while to load things, and for you Linux lovers, it doesn't run ubuntu 12.04 very well and glitches a lot. It glitches worse on VirtualBox than running it dually.  The mouse is a touch sensitive pad where you tap twice to click yet doesn't work and sometimes highlights things instead of selecting.  Biggest Con: For some reason, when you turn the Caps Lock on or off, a notification pops up and does not let you type until the notification goes away. There is no option in the control panel to turn it off, but a temporary fix I have found is to change toggle keys on or off. Sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn't.  This is the worst laptop I have ever had and I am thinking about switching to a mac. At least I won't have to hear the hardware clicking on and off all the time.  I was expecting better from a $750 ultrabook, but all I got was a piece of crap.
__label__4 Received as an 'Open Box' from Amazon !!  I ordered this laptop from Amazon despite reading the warning in the review below and indeed received an OPEN BOX!!  I am sending it back too and am not sure if I will receive an NEW unopened laptop if I was to reorder.  I wonder if any one in customer service can assure me this?
__label__3 Had to put this in storage as I can't afford to buy another mac just for the new OS. Its so old that not much runs on it anymore. Paperweight basically.
__label__2 No! Virus prone!  No matter what virus protection I bought my laptop kept getting attacked and it took forever to open anything up!
__label__4 Good laptop for the price  I bought this toshiba satellite a205-s5804 at bestbuy for $450 a couple of months ago. After making several research, this laptop seems to be the best for tis price. I upgraded the ram to 2 GB , I bought kingston 1gb kvr667d2s5/1g from Newegg for $18.99/each, I installed it with no problem. This is my second laptop after my IBM R40, i guess it makes sense to buy a new laptop than to repair the old one. So far, I have no problem. I disabled all the startup program except the sidebar, and my computer opens fast. The only problem I had was, I was not aware that you have to turn on the wireless internet connection by switching on a button that is on the front edge of the notebook, it lights up once you have it on. I have to use a cordless mouse because the tab on the mouse pad is not soft to touch and you will hear a loud tapping sound everytime you press on it. I have a black laptop, with a white keyboard. I never realize that it is easier to read the letters on the keyboard when it is white. Keyboard is soft to touch and wide enough for people with big fingers. The sound is good, after my experience with the IBM's lousy sound. I like the wheel on the front edge of the notebook to adjust the sound.
__label__3 Top is a little dulled and scraped for A rating
__label__3 The computer is good  Now I said the computer is good, however, dealing with the home company is not.  No matter what you say or who you talk to you get the telephone suffle and parroted apology for the wait, usually 2 hours. I suggest you shop elsewhere where you can get help.
__label__4 its a good buy  i got this laptop and like it but just wasn't for me i say if u like a good small loptop i say get this it is a nice peace of equipment
__label__5 Fast, sleek, one sweet machine  To be honest I've had little computer time on our new Apple MacBook as my kids have been too busy using our new computer.  What little time I have spent using the Apple MacBook has been fast and sweet. This is one sleek, fast machine with a nice size hard drive.  We added the Paralells software and Windows XP software to run our PC programs ---- and so far no problems. The computer just zips along.  Wonderful machine. No doubt about it.
__label__5 Awesome  This machine is awesome for its price! I bought it 2 weeks ago and Im very satisfied so far. Although the 1415-S173 features a Celeron, the lite chip from Intel, it has a full 256 KB of L2 cache so its performance nearly matches those of the far more expensive Pentium 4 chips (since until Northwood core arrived, P4s featured 256 KB L2 caches). Besides, the processor is a mobile battery-friendly chip. The laptops hard drive is pretty fast and spacious; its DVD/CDRW unit works flawlessly and is among the less noisy units Ive ever seen. It burns CDs at a 24X speed! DVD or DIVX reproduction is as smooth as a silk (not to mention DIVX encoding, is fast!). Ok, it has only 16 MB of video memory but those are real MB, not shared ones, so their performance is a way better if compared to most laptop graphics within the price range. Also, the graphics chip, which is what really makes the difference, is a speedy GeForce 4 Go 420! (NOT an ATI M6-C). This machine shines in games (they look gorgeous in its huge and bright 15 screen), even in some newer ones like NFS 6 or Unreal Tournament 2003 (maybe it doesnt matches the standards of high end desktop graphics of course, but those titles were still perfectly playable). My only complaint about this machine is its weight you should have strong shoulders if you want to carry it around. However, I still give it an A+
__label__3 Still waiting  Mouse button in the middle of the keyboard was missing, one of the jacks on the back was bent and unusable. I continue to have to cancel the Microsoft owner check that comes up when booting. Seller promised the mouse button would be replaced and mention other things to correct the problems, so far still waiting for the button etc. Otherwise the laptop works fine and no problems to date.
__label__5 Great Value, Great Platform, Great Notebook!!  Having last owned a Mac about 10 years ago (Mac Classic in college), I've been eagerly looking at the platform since the release of OS X. I've recently switched both my home (eMac) and mobile computers (iBook) to Mac, and don't intend on ever going back.  The iBook is a great value (especially if you are able to get the Amazon rebate), and is a very complete package. In has pretty current hardware (1.2 Ghz G4 works great for most all current apps, but upgrade the RAM!), great functionality (small and compact with no edges to snag your clothing or your backpack, 6 hour battery life, built-in 802.11g wireless networking, great included iLife apps), great Apple industrial design, and a great operating system in OS X Panther.  Another truly great feature of the Mac notebooks is its sleep mode. Close the lid and the computer goes into power-saving sleep mode, where will happily sleep for days and days without using up the battery (I don't remember when I last reboot or shut off my iBook.) Open the lid, and it is awake and ready to go in a second or 2. Windows notebooks have this feature too, but my last couple of notebooks always end up crashing or locking up (1 was Windows 2000, the other was Win XP Professional), preventing me from using this feature. My understanding is that they take up more juice in their sleep mode as well, so they can't be used like the iBook- I feel completely comfortable putting my computer to sleep for the night without the power adapter.  Finally a comment about the Mac platform. Switching to a Mac is not as 'traumatic' an experience as is made out to be. Web, email, photos, music- all these applications are cross-platform and interchangeable between Windows and Mac users. Microsoft Office is almost completely cross-platform compatible as well. I also had a pleasant surprise the other day when I logged onto my Windows network at work with my iBook, with NO CONFIGURATION necessary! (when they set up the new network, an admin had to spend about half an hour on each Windows PC to make different necessary changes!) I don't know how that is, but within 5 minutes I was copying files from the network servers and printing to a network printer.
__label__3 Great core/features, needs fine tuning  First, I will ignore all aspects Vista related.  This Vaio has some nice power, a good feature set, and is one of the cheaper 17" that comes with an HDMI (an awesome feature if u download movies or have an hdtv.  However, its needs a serious run through on the physical design, especially around the keyboard.  The keyboard looks like it belongs on a 12 inch top.  though the actual buttons are large, there poorly spaced and arranged.  The entire keyboard has sooo much room around the edges that it begs the question "why didn't they use this space for the keyboard?".  The pros: Excellent speed/cost ratio Beautiful screen and 1080 HD HDMI  The Cons: The keyboard is TINY considering the real estate they could have used. The screen is so heavy, it requires one hand to hold the bottom down, while the other lifts the screen up. The screen has a 1 inch black bar all the way around that increases the overall size of the laptop.  I gave this 3 stars because it really has some nice potential, and any person who spends five minutes with it can see that it would be greatly improved with some minor changes.  But, its been reliable for me, powerful, and came at a good price.  In the end, you could do worse.
__label__2 battery life unacceptable!  everything else pretty good but for so small laptop battery is number one priority that's why my low ratings. It's no way to get more then 40 minutes on full charge, not to mention it takes same discharge when on standby which is ridiculous.
__label__2 Satellite ES 5034: Hard drive problem within a year  Laptop started slowing just before expiry of warranty. Toshiba tech support made me do factory restore after which laptop worked fine for few weeks. Started experiencing same issues - it will take forever to load operating system. Called Toshiba tech support but unfortunately warrant had expired after 1 year. The help desk first blamed the operating system windows 7 then asked me to sell the laptop. After further troubleshooting the tech support agreed that the hard drive has failed. So now I have to spend 100 bucks in hard drive and recovery media.  I had bought this laptop for my wife. I have a Lenovo which is still working smooth after 4 yrs. I will never buy Toshiba laptop again
__label__2 Very poor quality. Can't recommend.
__label__1 Incompetent and unresponsive seller  Seller did not respond to my request to cancel my order and shipped it anyway two days after the order was placed.
__label__1 Not recommend, was sent macbook with dead battery  Bought an used (very good condition) macbook pro, and battery was dead on arrival. I realize it was used, but nothing was said about a dead battery.
__label__5 Extends the meaning of computer.  What a surprise this little book sized laptop has been! It does 95% of everything I might want a computer for and - it is there when I need it.  I got the 800mhz/.5GB RAM, 4GB disk model. Reading the specs this seemed like an "acceptibly" slow web browser. It turns out this little thing runs faster than my 3000mhz/2 GB RAM, 160GB disk workstation. It boots up in 28 seconds, connects to wireless web in 10 more. I'll be browsing before the big box even gets to signon. It is the Solid State Drive advantage.  Xandros Linux with KDE dosen't look exactly the same as Windows XP but I don't even notice. Firefox browser is the same, Open Office Documentss and Spreadsheets are closer to the original MS Office I learned than pushy new Office 2007. The PDF reader is extra usefull because you can use this little thing a a book reader.  I'm not expecting to make any historical videos with the built-in webcam but it works and is handy. You can carry this light little device around showing and talking at the same time.  It's mail is the web: Gmail, HotMail, Yahoo, and AOL servere for email (although you could probably easily download and add Thunderbird). Wikipedia, Skype, Google Docs, Pidgin Instant Messanger and internet radio bring home the message. This is a Web 2.0 appliance.  The  keyboard is small but workable, much better than a cell phone. The touchpad is small but it works. I've added a small usb mouse and a portable keyboard in case I need more serious data entry.  As well as the 3 USB ports it has ethernet jack and an an external video connection. I used mine during a presentation. This tiny little desktop was driving an 8 foot high projection monitor.  And no, it didn't get unacceptdly warm. I don't know how someone made that up. The power supply is 20 watts, a normal laptop around 90.  For anyone technical, I've downloaded a LAMP stack and Drupal and am now running a web server. My PHP works. You can get in as Root / SuperUser download and setup whatever you like. (If you're not technical, forget you read this, you don't need to know anything. Just start playing, no instructions needed.)  The small (4GB) hard drive is no problem. For smaller documents there's the SD card slot (I've got the transcend 8gb high speed), USB thumb drives, external hard drives and of course the web.  This is a true internet appliance.  I've also got an OLPC XO. Other than apperance, the Ausu looks like a minature computer, the OLPC a tool, they're very similar. OLPC has a better display and maybe a half hour longer batttery life. (2.5 hrs vs 2). Both have power supplies around 20 watts.  The Eee runs much faster though and I really prefer the Xandros/KDE desktop over Fedora/Sugar. Both can be reconfigured. They say you can dual boot to Windows XP on the Eee. I doubt the XO is fast enough though. In any case both are real cool - and so inexpesive another 10% or so of the world's population could afford one.  In the middle though is every employee at a company, kid at a school, technician or patient in a hospital, customer, .. Instead of a single $2000 Mac Air consider 5 or so of these plus a web app. There's a new class of web apps waiting to be written.
__label__3 So-so laptop  Heavy, the trackpad not very responsive ( it's refurbished, but still), the speakers are very bad. The screen is good and the processor is fast, so for $275 is ok.
__label__1 2-month old MacBook Pro dead  I typically don't write reviews, especially the low-score one, but I felt I have the obligation to tell this to everyone.  It's a nightmare, my 2-month old MacBook pro dead. I used to have IBM thnkpad T-series notebook (now Lenovo) and it was great compare to this Mac in terms of reliability. I can carry the IBM thinkpad to work in the morning and bring it back to home in the evening without power down for SEVERAL weeks, there was no issue at all. I thought I was little rough to the thinkpad so I power down this Mac everyday after the work, carefully carry it around, well, when it happens, it happens, all the sudden, it dies. I'm in the process to recover the data, I'm mad. I'll update the review later for the service experience, so far not very good either.  Another issus is you can't fold down the screen compeletedly outwards, it will break it. Bad design, image accidentaly you push down the screen for better view angle and you could break it and that's not covered by warranties.  Regardless how great the MacBook is, it's a great pain when your working computer dies, you need get it repaired, resintall the application, recover the data if possible, and re-do all your work if data is lost, what about the photos you took for the special moment yesterday that haven't upload yet... too bad.  No, I don't want anything fancy, I just need a reliable PC to do my things (paper, dissertation, spreadsheet, make movies), which all PCs on the market can do.
__label__2 Battery Life issue  Such a disappointment. The laptop is great and agree with the other reviews. We already had one (version 2010) and it works like a charm. Unfortunately, I bought the 2012 version where the battery last 2 to 3 hours if you are lucky. For me, the battery life and weight are the most important for a laptop. I read a lot of things, contacted apple, went to apple but I am still with a great piece of hardware that I need to plug every 2 hours. Apple lost it and they are now too big to be customer focus like in the earlier days. This is my last Apple purchase. Sorry Steve but your legacy has lasted less than a year.
__label__2 Despicable battery life between charges, metal exterior too delicate.  The battery life is a laugh. I was told it would get stabilized with use and last longer, never happened. It's somewhat heavy and the aluminum case is like butter, it will show even the most minuscule scratches and bumps. The matt finish immediately evidences stains with normal use, and you have to keep cleaning it over and over for it not to look dirty. Nice fashion design, absolutely impractical, and the battery use is worthless, a full charge vanishing just be using Word and some Internet searches and editing photos in a couple hours, with luck.
__label__4 Good for the money (VGN-FW145E)  Pros: Good screen: although mine has a one dead pixel, it is better than my previous ones (IBM T43 and Acer Aspire 5100).  It is one of shiny ones, but as others mentioned, they did a good job of eliminating glares.  Nice audio:  as far as I know, it is one of the best on a laptop.  I have always disappointed on laptop's speakers, but this one rocks!  And the microphone and camera work very well too.  Good processor: 2.26GHz P8400 is not the best, but it does much better than may others.  For me it is fast enough.  Nice keyboard: I was bit worried about the unusual shape of it, but it is quite comfortable to type.  A little wide for my taste, though (I have small hands).  Oh, and it's very cute, as you can see in the pictures.  Cons: Video: I knew it won't be the strength, since 145E has a shared video card, but still I wish it does better.  If you want to play games, you may want to get a model with an independent video card (but you have to pay for it too!).  Size: I reckon someone was comparing MacBook Pro and this model, but it is not a fair comparison.  This vaio is not designed for carrying around. It is a desktop replacement, I think.  USB: having all of USB port on the right front can be an issue when you have a small desk as I do...  Overall, I'm very happy with this model.  For the amount of money I paid (about $1050), I don't think there are any other models that can offer as much as this one.  If you are looking for an inexpensive desktop replacement with a nice big screen, and if gaming and other graphic intensive tasks are not your things, I recommend this model.
__label__1 Bad Hardware  Very disappointed. The hardware went after eight months. I recommend that you don't buy refurbished computers. Someone needs to help me find this retailer so I can see if I can get my money back. Who can help me?
__label__5 Great notebook....great OS!  I love my macbook! It is just amazing, i had a couple of monts deciding which laptop i should buy. A mac was not in my list, but when the macbook came out I know it was just perfect, great price AMAZING features.  So well i picked the 1.83 model, it has everything you may need and more, iLife, totally useful, photo booth to entertain yourself a lil bit and front row! front row is awesomei tlet you see all your pictures, videos, dvds, etc. And using it is just amazing, it feels like using your iPod!!  The mag safe power conector is awesome,luckily  my mac has not been threated by any fall, but knowing it won't go flying is really cool.  Mac os x its just really intuitive, i had never use a mac before and i thought it would be a little though at first,but none of that! the next day i had all my info in my mac!!  This computer its beautiful, inside and out, the apple logo in the front looks georgeus when its illuminated.  I would have just like it had a super drive and not a combo drive:( but well it cant be perfect!  The only issue is that the computer runs extremely hot!! specially on the bottom, its not like some people say that you can not even touch, you can use it perfectly, but i would recommed you to use it in your lap.  In conclusion, I think this is the better laptop i could have bought! i simply love it!!
__label__1 ... two days my supply cord just stopped working that's bad business for real  It is a shame after two days my supply cord just stopped working that's bad business for real
__label__3 Fun and fast...poor battery life  I have had my MacBook Air 11" for about a month now, and for the most part, I really love it.  Although small, the screen is clear and bright, and the full-size keyboard is as good as one from a bigger computer.  Buyers with poor eyesight may want a bigger screen.  The unit boots up very quickly, and although I don't do complex graphics or video work, it handles basic web browsing, streaming video, and other tasks with ease.  The size is fantastic, and it is extremely portable.  I would advise a protective case, however, as the aluminum skin is more prone to scratches than I would have imagined.  My only real complaint with the computer is its very poor battery life.  Although Apple advertises five hours of battery life, I can barely get 2 1/2 hours, and that is with the screen brightness turned almost all the way down.  A computer designed for portability should have a longer batter life.  Overall, if you are looking for a computer that is thin, light and reasonably powerful, the MacBook Air may be a good choice.  If you need a computer that will get you through a coast-to-coast flight or a three-hour meeting, look elsewhere.
__label__2 Don't be fooled by the sexy shell... this notebook is not a keeper  First of all, the good stuff: This notebook is light and thin, making it great for traveling.  The display is pretty decent and it has an HDMI output.  It's powerful enough for day to day use and even some light gaming, and it works perfectly with Ubuntu.  Now the bad stuff: The keyboard is atrocious.  There's really no way around it.  I've gotten more or less used to it now, though that means I'm still having 1-2 keystrokes drop out every sentence or two.  The trackpad is... okay at best.  The horrible stuff: When the system is under high load (gaming, major processing, etc.), removing the power cord results in an immediate shutoff.  Not a shut-down -- it simply powers off as if it had no battery.  This would be an annoyance if it weren't for the fact that the power cord loosens up enough after about six months that you need to rest the notebook on a flat surface and have a keyboard and mouse on a totally different surface so as not to slightly jar the machine.  A vibration such as a good solid tap on the touchpad is enough to make the power cord fall out and the machine crash entirely.  I personally won't be buying another Asus after this experience.
__label__3 Not a great as I had originally reviewed. [Updated 10-10-2010]  I purchased the HDX 1140-US for my son. This machine is beautifully constructed, and functions incredibly well. I don't think you can find this much bang for the buck, including dedicated video memory, in another unit in this price range. I think HP hardware has really improved over the years - not so thrilled with their peripheral drivers, though.  My only complaint - probably not really HP's fault, but they are contributing to the propagation - is the inclusion of Vista. There are much more competent OSes available, but as long as Microsoft has the vendors in their pocket, I guess we will be stuck with it. Although Ubuntu and others are available, some drivers can be difficult to find.  Please convince me that there is a functional reason why Vista cannot be backwards compatible? Why should we have to keep the old laptop around to run XP-compatible software?  Shop for a good price and rebates and you'll enjoy this laptop - just don't recycle that XP machine quite yet.  UPDATED 10-10-2010: 1st repair: The laptop I purchased went in for service when a key fell off the keyboard, several months ago; 2nd repair: The unit's back-lighting went to the extended warranty company for a defective screen back-light - returned with no trouble found, then failed again about a week later. Back for service, where they told me that the unit had not been assembled correctly, and that caused the problem. Who didn't assemble it correctly? Factory, Warranty, First service personnel? 3rd repair coming soon: After getting this back from number 2, above, now the volume, treble, bass adjust screen appears randomly - unless the sensor controls are VERY clean.  I wish I could like this laptop, but we have been without it for the past 2 or so months. I cannot recommend an HP - or any other laptops for that matter. Too bad you can't just home-build a laptop as easily as a desktop.
__label__1 warning:  the laptop did not work and was a piece of poop. . .so is the seller
__label__2 Great with just ONE problem...  Worked great until a week into it. The 1, q, a, z keys went totaly out. Havent worked since.....but other than that its been great. I am sure it was just a one item thing..
__label__2 The trackpad Ughhhhhh  I loved everything about this laptop, the style, the breathable keyboard, loved the fact that the computer never got hot (In comparison to my MACbook pro). This was absolutely fantastic but for the trackpad. I did read some reviews describing the touchpad problems, and yet others said they faced no issues. I decided to order it via amazon. The touchpad was really making the cursor jump all over the place. I spent long time over tech support downloading drivers etc.. They finally told me, the only way to solve it is to disable -tap to click. I think that is too harsh for my taste. I want to be able to just tap anywhere on the trackpad. Hell, even the basic Dell models can do it. I had to return this one. Amazon.com was really helpful in understanding my concern. :)   PS: This laptop had some really good multi-finger touch gestures, best I have seen on any windows laptop.
__label__3 it runs ok  Software is rundown
__label__4 Great Product for the Price  This was a great laptop for the price. Super fast shipping!  It was shipped the same day I bought it!  I was a bit disappointed because there was not a restore CD like was listed in the title but other than that I would recommend this seller!
__label__3 In our opinion, SONY no longer a reliable vendor  My wife & I bought this laptop from Amazon on November 4 to replace a 10 year old Thinkpad & supplement another 2 year old SONY laptop we own. We are very pleased with the new laptop. It is attractive, easily portable despite its screen size, & appears to have been manufactured with high quality parts & standards, We use it primarily for internet search & email, & are pleased with its speed & ease of use. We have not found Windows 7 to be the great leap forward that most seem to believe, but that is probably because we don't use many of its features........We have rated the new laptop only 3 stars because we believe that many who buy a SONY [at a premium price] expect more in the way of after-the-sale service than they would from most other brands. Unfortunately, that has not been our experience. Recently, our 2 year old SONY laptop suddenly developed wide white lines on its screen which made it unuseable. Although the warranty had expired, we thought it was reasonable to ask SONY if it would help with repairs, particularly after learning that other owners had experienced similar problems. After a series of exasperating & unproductive emails with SONY service, I finally wrote to SONY's CEO. The employee who responded agreed to pay a portion of our $365 repair cost for a replacement screen installed by a local computer shop. That was more than a month ago. We have never received the payment, and our repeated followup inquiries by email, fax & phone have gone unanswered.......We decided to buy the new SONY laptop only after SONY agreed to share our repair costs on the old laptop. Needless to say, had we known that SONY would not follow through on its word, we would not have done so.
__label__4 Giant dwarf  The 4G is a wonderful "take every-where computer" for a busy world. It has programs for everyone and Linux OS is simple to use and learn. I added 2gigs of memory and never look back. If you're in need of a note taker, photo keeper, email source and more look no further than the ASUS Eee PC 4G. It's a Winner !
__label__2 Ya'll don't have garageband but other than that, its all good
__label__1 Broke within one month
__label__2 WELL WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FOR UNDER $200.  I really don't like writing negative reviews...however being that this product was a total let down I am forced to do this.  I received this machine very quickly and packaged very badly.  Wrapped in bubble wrap and inside a box that was too large with no cushioning.  Upon inspecting it seemed ok and it ran fine for 6 days.  On the 6th day i turned it on and the display screen was distorted and the colors and pixels were horrible...i couldn't even read the words on the screen.  After checking the display colors and calibrating it nothing worked, so being that I am not too computer savy I decided to leave it alone and take it to someone the next day.  Before i could do this on that same night windows prompted me for several important updates, so i let it update.  After the update installed the laptop shut down and never turned back on.  When i tried to turn it on i get a message that there was a problem with windows and it could not start properly, and it prompts for a windows restore disk..WHICH IT DID NOT COME WITH.  Points to consider: I have not downloaded anything into it Have not mishandled it Has not even been used much ..at very least 3-4 hrs a day I bought a laptop cooler for it  I just contacted Amazon about returning it and i had to give comment about what happened and they are supposed to contact the seller and then get back to me about what the seller tells them.  Amazon, I really do hope you do the right thing by me and fight for me to get this refund, I am a loyal customer and i would hate to think that I cannot get my money back because i will def lose confidence in shopping with you from now on.  At Tampalaptop I need my money back!  I will update this upon Amazons response to my return request  UPDATE: I received a call from Tampalaptop today and I asked for a refund, he had so problem sending me a return label and I should get my refund within 24hr after they receive the laptop.  I told them i would change my rating a bit based on the positive customer service...however since these are product reviews and not customer service reviews I will only go up one star.
__label__4 WONDERFUL  I really loved this computer!  Everything I have always wanted.  Keyboard was to small to type on.  If it had a standard keyboard, I would have kept it.  Loaded with nice software, automatically updated, wifi, no bluetooth, camera; etc, and good value.  I just couldn't live with the keyboard.  If they ever do come out with a good keyboard, I will buy it again and this time, keep it.  Hated to send it back.
__label__4 Great Laptop, but I don't know about the Vista Premium  I'm actually very happy with this laptop as it has and does everything I need it too.  The price is great and fit, finish and feel of the machine is good.  Initially the software was working OK, but after a week it is getting slower for some reason.  My old wireless machine with an AMD processor and WinXP is up and I'm surfing the internet before this one ever connects to the internet through my wireless network.  Sometimes I have to disconnect and reconnect the wireless adapter before I can surf.  I'm an experienced computer person but have not figured this problem out yet.  Could be that I need to buy WinXP for the time being until the Vista bugs are worked out.  I do recommend this laptop.
__label__5 Good Item  Everything was fine with this product, the shipping was extremely fast, and the product works great, item is great for school work and just browsing the net, also good to carry along with you, so far I have not had any complaints !!:)
__label__5 Durable piece of er... thing  I'm at UCLA and just rummaging around in my dorm for some food on top of my closet, when my hand slipped knocking over a huge ceramic bowl which fell on the keyboard shattering it (the bowl) into many sharp pieces.  But, the laptop seems to be okay with nary a scratch.  Herm, either they designed ceramic bowls to shatter without cutting things like a hand grenade, or this is some scratch proof laptop.
__label__1 Was not complete at all
__label__3 asus k601  Well it was the cheapest and had the largest screen and decent processor power for the bucks and also has all the fat wire connections on the right side, I'm left handed and use a mouse so this was good for me. those are the things I like. The things I don't like.. This has a built in video camera but it has a terrible latency problem.. 1/2 second delay, that's annoying. Audio wise there's white noise in the left speaker. It has no flash card slot and the CD / DVD recorder is slow at best. The cheapest they could put in this unit to keep costs down which also keeps me down. Another big problem is the lettering on the keys is so dim you need a bright light to see anything. The picture quality is okay but and tweaking it is minimal at best so if you're an artist, this isn't the unit for you. I'm an artist.:( All and all. For $549.00 at Worst Buy... I mean Best Buy. You could do worse... While I'm at it. Windows 7 is not compatible with windows explorer so you'll need to install FireFox. That browser works just fine. Windows should be ashamed on many levels. I have to change my printer out as it's not compatible with windows 7 and was with Vista which was and still is the worst OS they put out to date!!!
__label__2 Mixed feeling about this product  Pros: It is a fast computer. It stays cool. The design is very nice Cons: The battery life is less than one hour. Samsung does not offer 9cell extended battery for this product. The monitor is low quality. If you are going to watch movies you won't like this computer. Overall: This can not be used as a laptop since the battery life is too short. It can be used as a desktop if you are not watching movies.
__label__2 Touchpad not working  Touchpad not working !!!! Using mouse , laptop is good
__label__2 It kept freezing for STOP PLUGINS  I bought it just to play games on Facebook.. (Farmville & Slingo), just for those two games the laptop keep freezing/stop and ask for STOP PLUGGINS, I search the internet for the fix, and whatever I try (even the answer from Chromebook forum) it still keeps doing that.. which is really annoying & beat the purpose of me buying this laptop. The good thing is there's no virus & I can update/reverse to factory setting often & easy..
__label__5 Excellent Excellent Excellent  Pretty, precise, really works. Linux not a handicap. Keyboard big enough once you get used to it. Real virtue is its weight. I still use the 7 inch most (I also have a 901) because it is lighter, which is the main point of this machine.
__label__3 My New Laptop  My New Laptop I am not a geek who lives his life for a new computer but I have a collection of computers that includes one Windows 98 Desktop, a Windows XP Desktop and Laptop. A Vista powered laptop and and a Desktop and now a Windows 7 Laptop and Desktop.  It helps I maintain two residences. I bought the laptop from Amazon because of its price and thought it would be a good transition instrument from XP and Vista to Windows 7.  It was!!  The price was right and it enabled me to follow my transition to the new program in an orderly manner.  It was several days before I discovered it did not have a drive for a DVD or CD and I would have to use a USB port to input data.  This was an incomvenience but did not divert my satisfaction.  I would recommend this product for a transition to Windows 7, a Traveling Laptop, and a regular all around computer.
__label__1 Didnt' work  Didn't work, didn't even boot up - sent it back
__label__4 Not bad  I have had this notebook since November of 2004, right out of the box anyone switching from a P.C. desktop or notebook, will notice the trackpad is sluggish and not very accurate. I called apple and went to the apple stores, everyone told me this is how the trackpads work for apple machines, even the desktops with mouses are like this( I thought my trackpad was broken ) They don't use the current mouse or redwood software, you have to find a free shareware named sidetrack, this will allow you to calibrate the tracpad to your liking and enable the side and vertical scrolling. (this is for those individuals who thought they couldn't get that option with apple notebooks) and you should upgrade the memory from 256 to 512 at least. (...)  The notebook itself is very nice, heavy compared to P.C. notebooks with the same size, but the material is much better and more sturdy with the ibook. Fast procesor, nice bright backlid screen and terrific battery life, I get an average of 4.5 hours or normal real time use (unlike P.C. notebooks that advertise 3 hours, but in real time use, surfing the web, typing, they end up low on power in 1 and 40 minutes) I mean why advertise you get 3 hours but only if you leave it on and don't do anything with it. I guess that is where apple came up with their 6 hours for the ibook on their website. Get this notebook if you travel and need word documents, spread sheets and internet. Do not get it for games (since Macs don't get any and if they do, they are buggy) This is a very nice notebook, great for students. Hope this review was helpful
__label__1 Packaging was great, concerned as to why it was cold and ...  The computer runs very slow and does not have the usual apps am unable to update this laptop because it is outdated and will not support, I bought this laptop for my son as a christmas gift unfortunately am a unsatisfied customer.
__label__5 Great Linux laptop  This is an ultra-portable laptop with Linux and wireless Internet access.  * Can mount Windows SMB shares. * Plays DivX, MP3 and YouTube videos. The Firefox already had a MPlayer plugin. * You can install and run RealPlayer for Linux on it if you want. There are web sites that show you how to add Windows audio and video codecs so you can play WMV or other Windows format audio/video files. * Mine already had Java 5.0. * The location of the Right shift key needs some getting used to. Keys are quite small and I can't keep typing on it for an excessively long time. * Was able to login to using my Skype account and make VoIP calls right out of the box. There are green and pink jacks for the headphones and mic. * Dictionary was set to Chinese language by default but you can set it display English. * The E-book reader is able to display Plucker format e-books from Project Gutenberg. * It displays PDFs using Adobe Acrobat Reader and the displayed text is quite readable especially in Full Screen mode. * Setting up wireless internet connection was very easy. * You can plug in a USB stick and it gets automounted. A "Flash disk" window automatically comes up with the contents of the drive. * The E-Book icon gets lost after you do a Software Update but there are web sites that show you how to put it back. * Ctrl-Alt-T launches an xterm. Running konqueror gives you a bunch of useful utilities. * GNU Emacs and MIT scheme both are not installed but they can be installed if you need them and they do run well on it. Read about adding Xandros repositories and pinning repositories first before attempting to install software using apt-get. Check out the unofficial EeeUser wiki site for photos and a lot of useful info. * It is possible to NFS mount shared filesystems. Just add nfs entries to /etc/fstab and they'll be mounted when the wifi interface comes up. You'll probably want to unmount them manually though before shutting down the eeepc: sudo umount -t nfs -a.
__label__3 Good condition  Good Computer just need new battery
__label__3 Good Netbook, but it's still slow Web Browsing  I like the design and size of the Acer netbook.  I like that it has Windows 7 home installed, and it seems speedy when running programs, and running videos (720p is OK, 1080p lags sometimes) that reside on the computer.  The screen is big (compared to other netbooks) bright, and the ergonomics are pretty good for a small netbook.  I installed the 4GB of Ram, and it seemed to make a slight improvement in speed.  On the downside, it seems that Web browsing and streaming video over the web in HD and even standard definition is very laggy (Netflix uses Silverlight).  Also when just web surfing using MS Internet Explorer, Firefox or even Chrome, it seems that web pages still load too slowly for my liking.  Either it's the slow processor, or maybe the Wireless card (radio) that's installed in this thing.  I have 2 other laptops that work off my Wireless router, and they are fine, so it's not my router speed-- it's definitely the Acer that's slow.  I estimate that it takes about 4-5x longer to load a web page than my 4 year old full size work laptop.  Not fun.  I bought this to be casual web surfing machine for couch work while watching TV.  However, since it's fairly slow web surfing, I find myself booting up my other big laptops for speedier web surfing, which defeats the main purpose of the netbook.
__label__4 Works great, my family uses this MacBook  Works great,my family uses this MacBook everyday
__label__2 Noisy, short battery life  Pros: OS Build quality is superb Great touch-pad.  Cons: I can confirm that battery life is quite short, I was not able to get even 5 hours just browsing Even 720p video from youtube makes this thing sound like a small airplane. Fonts rendering in Safari is less sharp than on my OpenSuse desktop Firefox Strong unpleasant smell when powered on
__label__3 Reply for Dell D600  ok laptop for the price. Had to put in  a new battery cause the one shipped only held charge for 20 min.  DVD needed an  upgrade which was 39.99.  Does the job for the price paid.
__label__3 Good device Not worth it  The device itself is not bad and if your willing to pay for simplicity then it may be good for you. However don't expect it to replace your windows or mac computer. If this were around 100$ then it would be worth it but for a lightweight OS that can not play Netflix, use Facebook's new video chat integration with Skype nor do any sort of advanced video editing or provide a proper IDE for developers, this device feels restricting at times. The device is also slower than mac's and p.c's and running the chrome browser is faster than running this. This device cannot play any sorts of games that is more advanced than angry birds or balloon tower defense. (Probably because of the weak processor) For ordinary tasks such as emailing, using social sites such as Google+, or even watching 360p or 480p videos on YouTube work just fine and as you would expect them to. The trackpad is not terrible but not great either still needs work. The keyboard though is nice and I prefer is actually over the mac's keyboard. The battery life is amazing and has never died on me.
__label__1 A lemon  We purchased a Macbook Air two years ago and unfortunately it was a lemon right out of the box.  Almost immediately there were problems with pixels on the screen going out in large vertical bands, over-heating, sluggish performance.  We purchased it for our son to use during extended travel in China, reasoning that the light weight would be a plus in these circumstances.  Unfortunately, Apple doesn't have any service in China so he was unable to get the problems fixed.  When he returned from China we took the Air into Apple for repairs.  That was the beginning of a long cycle of multiple repairs and the nightmare of dealing with Apple service.  I've never encountered so many frustrations with a computer company.  Perhaps if you've ever had any serious problems with an Apple product you might know what I'm talking about.  It seems that other reviewers have been pleased with their Air, so it is entirely possible that our experience was the exception rather than the rule.  However, a lemon should be caught by Apple's quality control process BEFORE it goes out the door, before it gets into an unfortunate customer's hands -- and that didn't happen in this case.  Some things a potential buyer should be aware of...  The Air is basically a stripped down computer, with things such as a CD/DVD drive not included, in order to reduce the weight.  But you still need these components.  By the time I had purchased the additional items, including the expensive CD/DVD drive, the total package not only came close to $3000, but weighed significantly more than my small, light weight Sony which is a fully loaded computer, including DVD drive and extended life battery.  Finally, from our experiences with trying to get the Air repaired, we learned that many of the internal components, including the hard drive, are non-standard and not easily replaced when they go bad.  When my Sony died after 5 years, I was able to remove the hard drive, a miniaturized Toshiba, and transfer it to an external case, enabling me to continue using my data with another computer.  Not so with the Air.  When the Air died recently, although still under the extended warranty, Apple was unable to offer any assistance in removing the hard drive.  Their service dept. said that the Air hard drive is non-standard and that Apple doesn't service it at all and that it can't be removed.  We gave up on Apple and took the Air to a local PC lab that was able to remove the hard drive and transfer the data to a new device which can be used externally.  To be fair, we've had other Apple products that have performed well and that we've been mostly happy with.  Now, however, the frustration level, not to mention time and expense, in dealing with the Macbook Air and Apple service has turned us off to Apple forever.  We'll be sticking to PCs from now on.  Our Air, which still has more than a year of warranty on it, has totally died and we've dumped it for an Asus.  Check them out, they get excellent reviews (rated highest for reliability), have incredible battery life (10-14 hours), have an amazing warranty, and they make some very lightweight models (the UL series).

Everything else is outstanding. My only complaint is the position of the USB outlets: they are located at the right hand side and they interfere with an external mouse.
__label__4 Great buy for the money  I recently purchased the asus laptop, and I must say that it is a great little system.  The operating system is very intuitive, and my 7-year-old son quickly managed to navigate through it with ease.  The only drawbacks, however, are that the screen is small, and as a result, I have had trouble reading some pages in my powerpoint program. In addition, the mouse bar is a bit awkward at times.  In the end, though, the product is a great bargain.
__label__2 It didn't accomplish my expectations (moving from Windows and Open Source OSs)  I've been using Windows a lot, and a different Open Source OS's for work.  And finally I decided to buy this machine for work and RAW photography processing, since Mac has a great user-friendly and stability reputation. I don't want to worry about computer problems a lot anymore.  My expectations were:  I - User friendly laptop so I don't worry fixing computer issues instead to be productive. That's why I choose a Mac product. II - Relative fast computer for scientific data processing, image analysis and RAW photography processing. Also for watching movies sometimes. That's why I choose a retina Macbook Pro III - Great portability for travel. This is: relatively small, thin, light and high battery duration. That's why I choose a 13-inch instead 15-inch.  So what I found in this computer was:  (+): 1. Screen, of course... this is a spectacular screen: great for image processing, so that is one point to favor. 2. Fast CPU: I use Matlab and Wolfram Mathematica a lot for data processing and image analysis and this computer does the job quite good and fast. 3. portability: very thin for the power and also it feels very light. Excellent battery duration (when I was in the train I turned WIFI OFF and I had 10 hour battery duration. With wifi ON could be 7 hours... now I have 12% of max capacity and it says 50min remaining)  (-): main disappointments: 1. (Hardware Performance) Wifi - Bluethooth problems at first day of use: slow wifi when bluethooth is ON 2. (Instabilities and errors) Alias (Mac shortcuts) serious problems caused 50% Mac storage use: I cannot delete the alias after I copy 60Gb of videos and photography to a backup, I'm been reading a lot of forums threads and my problems hasn't been solved yet... 3. (Instabilities and errors) It cannot play 60p videos at 60fps, despite it says is a 60hz display: I'm using a&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Sony-HDR-CX260V-High-Definition-Handycam-8-9-MP-Camcorder-with-30x-Optical-Zoom-and-16-GB-Embedded-Memory-Black-2012-Model/dp/B006K5507M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Sony HDR-CX260V High Definition Handycam 8.9 MP Camcorder with 30x Optical Zoom and 16 GB Embedded Memory (Black) (2012 Model)</a>&nbsp;and is a pity that I cannot watch my Full HD "high speed" videos (60p) at their original speed in the rMBP. 4. edit: (Instabilities and errors) Professional software crashes: I'm using ImageJ and Mathematica (lastest versions for Mac) and I'm experimenting a lot of crashes (OS is fully upgraded). I've been using these softwares and same codes in Windows and I didn't have those crashes... those problems make me lose a lot of time in data analysis...  another disappointments:  3. (Design) Keyboard may be printed in the screen 4. (Hardware Performance) solid state drive is not fast as I expected to be (reboot, copy files, running programs) 5. (Hardware Performance) The video card is awful for playing in retina full size, although I knew that and I accepted it... it still been a disappointment. How can this amazing screen has this video card? (I know that I said it was for work but is a temptation to play, for example, Diablo III or Starcraft II or Civilization V) 6. Comparing with the Lenovo Z580 (see EDIT)the website loads are a lot slower (using the same WIFI always), also the overall loads and photography processing is slower in the rMBP, since again there are too much pixels to manage...  Conclusions: I bought this laptop less than one month ago and I have been dealing with very annoying issues. I'm in a short-term internship in the US so I want to be productive instead dedicating my time to be fixing new Mac laptop issues, for example I have to move about 40Gb of data from an external HDD to the rMBP but I have corrupted files which are using about 60Gb of the 120Gb and I cannot delete them (even with secure delete or terminal or Disk utilities...) . I'm seriously thinking to return this product (I have 2 more weeks for that) and to buy maybe an Asus Zenbook or something similar. I'm quite disappointed.  EDIT (talking about the RETURN and what laptop I chose after the rMBP):   I finally returned this laptop for a full refund (thanks amazon), since I had to much annoying wifi, SSD and OSX issues; also the lack of decent performance for an overpriced (US$1614.00) laptop, I believed in apple reputation for the price, but it vanished quickly. Instead of that I bought a Lenovo z580 (Win8, i5 3210M, 8Gb Ram, Intel HD4000 Graphics, 15.6',750Gb Hdd) for $540.00 and it runs great, it doesn't print the keyboard in the screen, the overall performance is much better for me, no crushes, no issues, no inestabilities, a lot faster photography processing, and the WIFI feels faster as well, I almost hear the fan and everything is cool even with high loads of data... Also it has VGA port (that I use a lot for meetings and presentations, 4 USB ports (2x3.0,2x2.0)... I always use 2 (1 for mouse and 1 for external USB 3.0 HDD) and is nice to have some more to connect the camera or colleagues flash drives. Is nice to have ethernet port as well... the max battery life is around 6-7 hours so that's great for the price.    Should I add $1100 for a 120gb SSD (~$100), smaller but retina display? backlit keyboard? lighter? better multitouch trackpad? but less wifi performance, less usb ports, no VGA, no ethernet... Nah... $1100 is too much difference for the same internal performance laptop and some sacrifices! If you want it for more portability, to edit or just watch photography one by one, to brag with friends or just have a astonishing screen for studing, and obviously, if you can afford it... I think this is for you, and now the price is lower. I feel much better now and I saved ~$1100
__label__1 Bad product  Product I received was not as it was advertised. Product was advertised as having Windows OS. Received a wiped computer with no operating system.
__label__3 The battery gives 2 hours of use only..
__label__5 Really liked the laptop  This laptop is really worth the money. It's really fast and received in good condition. This is the first time i bought refurbished laptop. Initially i'm worried about buying used laptop,but now i'm really happy. Seller installed all necessary softwares for daily purpose. There is no unwanted softwares. I planning to add additional 2GB  RAM.
__label__5 TOSHIBA AND AMD TURION SUPERB COMBINATION  Beautiful design, superb technology, dazzling graphics and performance by AMD's Turion Mobile technology 64X2 Dual core make this Toshiba laptop fantastic value for the price !! I strongly recommend it !!
__label__3 Could of been better
__label__3 Annoying sounds  I bought this laptop(white one) in January... i really liked it at first but after a few months it started making sounds .. its really annnoying !!!
__label__2 lacking  the product i received was not what i ordered it is not a generation 4 i book but a generation 1 running ios 10.3 not 10.5 as listed. overall I'm very dissatisfied with the service and the false descriptions.
__label__2 Don't Like it  I got my Dell Inspiron about two weeks ago.  Three days ago I tried to turn it on and I saw was a black screen and a loud beeping noise.  I don't know what to do now.  I guess I will have to take it to get repaired.
__label__3 Great little book, but quality is hit or miss  I got so I could be more mobile during the holidays. It arrived and wouldnt work off the battery, as soon as you unplugged it even when it said the battery was 100% charged, it would die. Still waiting to see how amazon handles the situation because ACER has poor support and the idea of shipping the laptop to Acer to get fixed means I won't have it back till January....the eyes on you amazon. I have it three stars because this negatively influenced my experience with the unit. It is very much a great little unit, the full size key board, the sleek touch pad, its feature filled (minus the BlueTooth) with the camer, HD screen and card reader. I also noticed a sim card slot in the back but i think thats available on a different variation of this model.  If you want something that will get you through the day at a solid price this is a good bet, but be prepared that you may be one of the unlucky ones like myself. I'll keep you updated on this battery / logic board fiasco.
__label__3 Dell laptop is a good machine.  After having to return the first machine because it locked up withing the first two hours of operation I received my second machine.  It works fine but the battery life is less than 30 minutes.  So as long as I have it plugged into the wall it is a good machine.  The only negative is the battery life being so short.  But there was a statement in the bio of the laptop that gave no guarantee for the battery life.
__label__2 Nice Laptop, Flimsy Hinges  I've had this laptop for a little over a year now. It was absolutely great until the screen started to feel a bit flimsy about a month ago. Since then, the left hinge has totally broken and the frame of the screen is cracking because of the broken hinge. Now I can't close the laptop at all, the screen is leaning backward at an awkward angle, and I feel like it's only a matter of time before the screen detaches completely. Like another reviewer noted, this hinge problem is common with this model so be careful with this laptop. I loved this computer and am sad that the construction of it only lasted about a year!!
__label__5 laptop  It looks and responds great. The cd drive works and it has very limited body damage. I absolutely love it and can't wait to use it more.... Down side it didn't come with iMovie or iPhoto or garage band.
__label__4 is a lil more than ok less then perfect  We got this laptop and it works good. DISAPPOINTED bout the battery not working as good.. Its used I understand but it dies so fast after being charged alll day and I am not being drastic bout it.. So thats about it..Other than that bein an issue its works and we like
__label__1 The charger was glued together at the end. I had to buy a new one. There is no sound. I am unable to install any audio drivers.
__label__5 simple and functional  Well the only thing I can say is that Asus has done this little truly portable notebook the right way, it works!  If your looking for portability without the bulk of a traditional notebook this is it. The Eee is about the size of a small hardcover book and performs as promised.  I also added the 8 GB SDHC card for file storage. In the future as the SDHC format expands you could have truly unlimited storage at a reasonable price.
__label__2 Toshiba's design's problem  1. system is too hot, but some people happy if they stay in the Alaska 2. In the fist week, there are 5 tims of screen hang after system resume back if re-open the cover. I wrote a MS power point file for presentation to customer in my cubicle then closed the cover of notebook and brought it to conference room. The system is no screen anymore after I open bck the cover. I had to reboot my system and my PPT file was gone. I don't want it will be happen again, so I return it. 3. I didn't receive the credit back after I had sent it back to Amazon two weeks.
__label__5 EXCELLENT PRODUCT  It is an excellent product and it works perfectly of course is mac nothing better than this
__label__3 How ever they work good.  Very fast shipping.... I purchased 2 of these and on 1 the disk drive didn't work. How ever they work good.
__label__4 Good computer for the money.  Solid performer for the money have own Dell Latitude E6400 in the past and just bought a use one. Only complaints on the heavy side and could have a 15 inch screen.
__label__1 It sucks  I bought this laptop because it has wifi capability , but little did I know when I purchased it that I wasn't going to be able to use it at all. It has no sound hard drive, no wi-fi hard drive nothing at all. I gave it to someone at my church to fix and he couldn't even get it to work at all, non of the 2nd functions buttons work at all . I'm sending it back and I'm getting my money refunded. DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP AT ALL LOTS OF PROBLEMS TRUST ME.
__label__5 Cute little PC :)  Honestly, this is an AMAZING product. It is small, cute, light, and easy to carry, and use.  I found the Linux operating system pretty easy and yeah, it OPENS my Windows Microsoft office files.  I have no problem at all going wireless.  I like it and I recommend it to everyone.
__label__3 Good Price, but too old.  Couldn't do anything on this computer. So out of date. Gave it to my daughter. Anyone over the age of 12 I wouldn't suggest it.
__label__5 Good Laptop - Extremely Linux (Ubuntu) Friendly!  After spending a couple of weeks researching the current laptop market for a good general purpose, desktop replacement machine, I discovered the A135-S4427 was being sold at a nationwide chain as an "in store only" special for $200 off the list price.  That put it right at the price range I was looking at, and gave me a lot more than I was expecting at that price.  This A135 sports one Gig of ram which one pretty much needs as a minimum these days, and it has a decent size 120 Gig hard drive.  It has a nice bright 15.4" widescreen display, and mine has no light leakage or dead pixels.  I was afraid that there might be reflection issues with the glossy screen, but it actually has fewer reflections than the matte screen on the machine it replaced.  This model has a very nice DVD burner, and for a laptop the speakers aren't bad.  I don't know what inspired the designer to put the speaker/earphone jack in the middle of the front edge, instead of on the side or the back, but that's about my only gripe.  The standard battery leaves a little to be desired, providing only about 2 to 2 1/2 hours running time.  I think that for many folks this will be a desktop replacement machine, so that shouldn't be a big issue.  A higher capacity battery is available from Toshiba for those who need it.  As others have pointed out, this is not a gamer's machine.  But then, I didn't expect it to be.  After the research I did I would expect a decent gaming machine to cost somewhere in the neighborhood of twice the list price of this laptop.  This machine has a Core Duo processor, rather than the slightly faster Core 2, and like many machines on the market has the GMA950 video card.  The serious gamer won't find these acceptable, but for general use they are just fine, and most users won't find the slight jump in performance worth the big jump in price.  What I personally liked most about this laptop was the fact that when I replaced the Windows Vista Home Premium with which it comes with Ubuntu 6.10 Linux, everything worked (with the exception of the built in memory card reader, which is very minor to me).  Wireless, screen resolution, everything just worked.  No tweaking required.  Too cool.  A Shout Out too, to Toshiba for including a real Vista backup disc, instead of one of those "hidden partitions" which are becoming so common these days.  If and when I ever get around to selling this laptop I will probably load the Vista back onto it for the great uneducated masses who think that Microsoft is the only alter at which to worship.  In summery, this is a nice machine and a good value, especially if you can find it as I did, on sale.  It's not the fastest machine out there, nor one with the most advanced video card, but it's not priced in that range either.  For someone like me who spends a lot of time surfing the web, watching streaming video, listing to web based radio stations and just general computing, it makes a good, speedy all purpose machine.
__label__3 Yep, no recovery DVD's and no way to make  I've had my SONY VAIO FRV37 for 2 days, and it is going back.  I keep getting  a write error  when making recovery DVD's, ruined 4 of them already.  They were going to suggest I do the 10 CD method but before it was out of the mouth, I said nope.  Then they wanted to send me recovery DVDs for free, but why does the DVD writer keep having a write-error from the get go.  Reminds me of a Toshiba I once owned that I could not make recovery work after making floppies for recovery (24 of THEM!) that was junk from Day 1 and eventually had a class action suit against them that Toshiba lost, but the settlement was puny considering the grief that thing gave me.  Now, Sony has to go back.  CSR said he would take it back rather than take the free recovery DVDs, too.  That's good enough for me.  Do I give them another chance, or do I buy something else?
__label__3 Dell Latitude D610 14" Laptop Refurbished  Everything is good , except the battery will not hold charge, I guess it needs to be replaced, I assumed it would have a new battery. I bought this for my grandson and other than that he is pleased.
__label__4 I love it!!  I love this little laptop! It's so easy to use. My teenagers (18 and 16) love it too. I'm not a laptop expert and was skeptical, but I was able to use right out of the box and drove to our local Panera and checked out the wireless connection and it worked like a charm! It's really small, but that's what I like about it. I wanted mostly to surf the net and check e-mails and do my AVON orders and it has met my needs wonderfully!
__label__3 works  every thing is as described, works good, kind of sloww procesor but it is as described, read description and check out your needs first
__label__1 Doesn't hold charge an wouldn't buy again
__label__1 Beware  Laptop did not even power on. I had to send it back.
__label__5 Great Value Laptop  Perfect for email, web browsing, basic photos, basic videos, music, and word processing.  Probably not powerful enough for high end graphics, video editing, or gaming.  But, plenty capabale for everyday computing. I've used it to edit and create a home video DVD and it worked very well.  What else can I say? For under $500 (home deopot) this is a great value.  The screen looks great and feature set is the best I've seen for the price.  Update (7/21/08): I've had this for about six months now... no problems.  It's still a nice computer for the money.  I made a great 1 hour DVD for my daughter's one year birthday using a ton of high quality pics, videos, and songs and it handled it like a champ.  Granted, a really high-end computer might have done it quicker, this guy came through and got it done.  I'd still recommend it.
__label__4 A true go-anywhere office  I just bought a TX690, which I believe is the same as this model except with a blue cover and a half a gig more RAM.  Light, thrifty with the juice, and just as powerful as some of its larger cousins, I am very happy with this purchase overall. I can see no reason to go back to a bigger notebook for any reason.  It fits in a backpack with the rest of my gear; no need for a separate laptop bag.  The connectivity is superb, and once you get the hang of it, the VAIO connections manager software makes it incredibly easy to switch from one internet connection to another.  The Cingular EDGE feature is extraordinary.  You can pluck broadband out of the sky across wide stretches of the USA--no more searching for Starbucks or other hotspots. And if the EDGE network doesn't reach where you are, the Bluetooth feature makes it easy to do dial up via your mobile phone.  Just a couple of gripes that bust my rating from a 5 to a 4.  Sony has integrated the EDGE system into the software, so you can't switch telcos.  And with the most common plan at $80 a month, it's a bit pricy.  The screen is exceptional for its size, and the keyboard works as well as can be expected in such a small space.  But Sony could have improved the array of outside controls.  There's a set of buttons above the keyboard which is supposed to let you operate the machine as a dumb-terminal personal DVD player without booting up the whole system, but it's never worked 100% properly for me.  The touch-pad is, if you'll pardon the expression, touchy.  And the volume and mute buttons are fiddly.  The tight packing of so many components does cause a little interference in the built-in speaker--this disappears when connected to external speakers, but it kind of makes it useless as a personal DVD.  That said, if you really want a full functioned office that you can operate from anywhere, you can't go past the new TX series.
__label__3 Good laptop but...  First when i received this laptop it arrived two days late that wasn't so bad as it was not urgent that i need it. When i first used it it was working perfectly but after a short two hours i uninstalled some programs such as trend micro and asus vibe and when i had to restart it it would only show a black screen and the touch pad would not be responsive and the wifi would also not connect. Then i restored it to factory settings and did not uninstall anything and it works perfectly fine. now i need a program to uninstall all of the bloatware it is taking up to much hard drive space as i need all of it for my programs in my computing class. all in all great laptop too much bloatware and not enough hard drive space for all my needs. side note if anyone knows of any programs to delete bloatware please contact me thank you
__label__5 MacBook  Excellent product! This is the second one I've bought in the last year, as my daughter has loved hers. My wife now has one! No problems with the setup, or for the first month. Typical Mac - Fantastic!
__label__2 Expected much more from Asus  I gave this computer 3-stars because it does what I need it to do and the technical specs are pretty good. Not great for the price, but good.  Pros: has great sound, which is important to me. the SRS Premium Sound panel takes alot of playing with to get a good sound with whatever speakers you are using. I normally hate laptops mostly cause the mouse pads, but they copied Apple (in a good way) and made it so you can use 2 fingers anywhere on the pad and scroll instead of having a scroll bar on the side or whatever. I've found myself using other laptops and being confused by their lack of convenience. USB 3.0 makes transferring all my data alot easier and my phone and ipod charges super quick when i use the usb cable.  Cons: only a few days after the 30-day zero bright dot warranty expired i found a few dead pixels, that strangely seem to come and go. the entire thing is very flimsy; the keyboard depresses quite a bit when typing and the screen flexes as if nothing is behind the screen giving it support. it comes with a TON of preloaded games and Asus software, some of which im afraid to uninstall for fear of messing up the OS or BIOS. Pay attention to where your pictures and music and things are saved, as the default path leads to the smaller "OS" partition and it will fill up very quickly. The mouse gets annoying and worn out fairly quick. Even with trying to adjust the sensitivity it either grabs on to an internet tab or something and won't let go or it has a hard time double clicking. The webcam is less than 1 mp, so don't expect to do anything other than take a (well-lit) picture with it. I tried video chatting with my sister and there was so much delay she could see me moving at all. It was basically just audio. This thing puts out ALOT of heat, especially if you're playing a game or exporting a video or something. Fan sometimes has a hard time keeping the system cool even with proper ventilation, and making the whole thing hot and burning your leg anyway. I've almost melted my glasses by leaving them on the left side of the computer (where the vent is). Also if you're doing something very processor taxing such as gaming or video editing, make sure the vent is very well exposed. I know thats kind of a no-brainer, but I was exporting a video and tried storing it away in my very large and open keyboard tray while it did its thing. I opened it up to find it had almost melted its own screen. there was a big air bubble that went away when i flexed the screen towards me (something you probably shouldnt be able to do). The screen has gotten air bubbles from having the lid closed while doing nothing more than a virus scan.  So when it comes down to it, either look for a different model than this (N61JQ-A1) altho im pretty sure they don't make it anymore, or wait a month or 2 and you can get a much better system from any company with better specs for same price or less. BTW, the X1 is the same thing with a different hard drive size, so just keep that in mind.  *UPDATE* Their customer service is HORRIBLE. I sent this back in for warranty repair a month ago and never heard back despite two emails and a whole new 'Tech Request'. Maybe calling will have better luck?  *Update #2* 6/5/15 Demoted to 2 stars after going back and realizing what a piece of junk this was for $1100! Even 5 years ago, you could get more for less. After about 3 years, a hinge cracked and subsequently broke from normal use. Really?
__label__1 The Conspiracy of Apple for Their Older Computers Not Downloading Current Apps so You Will Buy an Expensive Newer Model  I wish now that I didn't buy this older Macbook because I can only use the PC Windows part of it as the Apple Store Apps have all been upgraded to OS X 10.10 or later and so they will not be allowed to download to the OS X 10.7.5 of my Macbook computer; and I cannot upgrade my system to a newer one either so I can get all the Apps I wanted to have on my computer because of the age of the computer.  I might as well have bought a much cheaper PC than this Macbook since they both will do the same things but nothing beyond them!  I will NEVER buy another Mac computer again as long as I live and unless all you want is another Macbook computer to use as a PC, then I would highly recommend that you buy a new Macbook (OS X 10.10 or higher) and not an older model as I did, but the newer models are very expensive and I don't think that they are worth all the expense so I would recommend buying a good but used PC instead and save big bucks from buying a Mac (despite all the hype which Mac users write to me, none of them are worth all of the big bucks they cost you besides getting a useless one as I did!)!  One reason some dealers told me that it was "better" to buy a Mac instead of a PC is because the Mac computers aren't usually hit by virus attacks as are the Windows PC but a good virus protection program is a lot cheaper than a Mac computer and will do the same thing!  Also, they speak of the longevity of the Mac but I've had my desktop PC (Windows 7) for a long, long time and it's still working out fine so that's a bunch of bull!  Besides, the Mac I have gotten won't last me very long anyway since I will either be selling it to somebody else or throwing it away if I can't sell it since it is a piece of junk!  So, my final recommendation is, for sure, DON'T BUY AN EXPENSIVE MAC (OR ANY KIND OF MAC) BUT BUY INSTEAD A GOOD PC WINDOWS 7 COMPUTER which is exactly what I should have done but will do in the future!  If you buy a Macbook computer (and especially an older one), then you are only throwing away your money on a useless piece of junk!  This is a conspiracy of the Apple Corp to not have any Apps for their older computers so they can sell you a brand new one but don't fall into this trap as I did and regret buying it in the first place!
__label__3 i am still work with friend to learn about it,no owner manual........
__label__4 What a Screen!  I just received this laptop yesterday, purchased on Amazon.com (sold by J&R). The delivery speed was top notch and now on to the laptop:  The size is very big yet thin and sleek but you definately don't realize how big it really is until you see it right in front of you. Set up was a breeze (~20 minutes) to get everything up and running. A great thing about this laptop is that it didn't have much pre loaded crapware to bog down the computer which was great.  The screen real estate is huge and it is beautiful. When the screen saver first came on (Windows Energy) I probably sat and stared at it for a good 10 minutes before I realized I wasn't doing anything.  The laptop also came with a nice remote control to handle all your media center needs and even slides into the laptop itself so you'll (hopefully) never lose it.  The hard drive is great but is partitioned into 2 drives which I don't really like but is a minor gripe.  The heft of the laptop is not as bad as I thought considering the size of the laptop.  I haven't checked out a blu-ray movie yet, (waiting for Dark Knight to come to my apt) so will post a revision once I see it.  The only con I have with the laptop is the mouse pad. It's not the typical mouse pad in that it feels like glass so your finger gains friction with the pad and doesn't glide as easily it does on other mouse pads. This is slightly frustrating but is probably something you will get used to after extended use.
__label__4 Good solid laptop, nice price  I got this laptop a few weeks ago from TigerDirect and I am overall quite pleased, despite some initial issues with getting the wireless card to retain a connection [1].  The keyboard is excellent and feels much better quality than those of comparably priced models.  It also feels quite solid; I went to Staples and held a couple of HP pavilion laptops in the same price range, but they felt sort of flimsy.  In terms of looks, I like understated, and it is just a nice fairly unadorned black.  The cover has a bit of a faux linen texture which adds a tiny bit of oomph, and also makes it less of a fingerprint magnet than some.  It seems to run quite well, in terms of speed, and the battery life is excellent (much better than other laptops I've had), and much better than a previous poster suggested.  I seem to be able to get 4 hours out of it comfortably.  I haven't watched a DVD on it, so that might make for a shorter span.  Anyway, after a few weeks, I'm pleased, and I'd recommend this as a cheap laptop that doesn't feel or perform like a cheap laptop.  [1] There's a setting for the wireless card whereby you can determine how aggressively it searches out a "better" signal; dial it down if you're primarily using your home network, or else it will drop your current connection as it tries for a better one.  You might also want to turn off/uninstall the Lenovo wireless card software, as it (according to my sources on the Google) can cause problems.
__label__2 After 1 week of use  I bought this from Amazon and it has 1 week of use now. Yerterday i see the screen has a problema. The plastic frame border on the bottom of the screen is detaching off. You can even see the glue they used to put the plastic frame on top of the screen. I noticed this happens because it get real hot in that part. Its exactly on the botton where the "acer" name is. Its the hottest part of this laptop. Its strange that since most laptops get hot on the bottom where batteries are. Well on that part is so hot that the glue melted and the plastic now leaves an open space between the LCD screen and the frame. Im really pissed off, this laptop has 1 week and this should not happen. I have used it allot, but always plugged into my desk. This should not happen after 7 days of use. Even a basic quality test should have detected this. And im with air conditioner in the office all the time so i cannot imagine how it would look if not. The whole plastic frame would melt. I know it will eventually melt the whole glue and it will come off. Luck it has 4 screws on each border so that will hold the glass on place. I cannot give this back since im outside the US and it costed me 100$ shipping. It has 1 year warranty but I would have to pay 100$ to ship it back and then again 100$ to receive the new one. So thats half of the cost of this laptop. I knew this was cheap and now you all know why. This will happen with all laptops of this model i suppose since when im mean that it gets hot there it really does, so that melts the glue which they used to put it together. I have an Acer 17 LCD which works excellent after 4 years of use, that why i went with Acer again. The screen on this laptop os beatifull, and it has tons or Ram that why i give it a 2 star. I don't thing its acceptable that this happened after 1 week, even when its only the plastic frame on the screen which should not affect the laptop dirt will get into that place and then i can trow this away. Nice 650$. Im sure this will not last me 1 year since if after 7 days this happens i don't give this laptop to much to live. Now you know why its so cheap, because its cheap build. Im sorry for Acer since i will never buy a product from them again. Next time I will go with my feelings and buy a Sony or HP. This was suppose to for work and I use computers for 10 hours straight a day so im sorry that i did not went with something of more quality.  Update May.  Besides that problem i mentioned the laptop rocks for the price. The plastic frame that holds the screen did not dettached further, only under the "acer" band but not allot. Gladly the plastic frame did not detached more, it seems that is where the screen gets the hottest point. The laptop is hot. Thats stil there. I will get a laptop cooler and I advice everyone that wants to use this for daily use for several hours does this. You cannot use it on bed or over the legs so hot it gets. Even my left hand when i type feels the heat coming from below. The heat i so intensive when you move it out of the table its still hot for a while where you left it. I don't care to much about but im sure thats why the LCD melted, since the glue that they use to paste the plastic on the frame is probably not make for such much heat.  Besides that the laptop rocks. I got like 3 or 4 blue screens a day but I found the problem. I thought it was the head but was Google Chrome. Other people mentioned this problems as well, so i uninstalled Google Chrome and no blue screens since then. Wifi is good. Overall i would give this a 3 and half star, but for the price i got it 650$ is a sure buy.  The colors are amazing, this is always increible in Acer since I also own a 17 LCD that is still going after 5 years.  I recommed this product but get a laptop cooler for it. Battery is also good. I got a logitech VX nano mouse as well.
__label__3 -_-  Its not something I would recommend to another person. It cannot use  window 7, or any other system. it doesn't have a lot of memory in it. Its as if it been remove.
__label__3 Working well so far
__label__1 Tantalizingly close to being perfect, yet useless.  I will keep this short.  It is an awesome little computer at a great price EXCEPT for two things:  1) SOME OF THEM ARE LEMONS and randomly lock up when you are using them.   and 2) ACER has conveniently setup a corporate bureaucratic obstacle course to keep you from returning the LEMONS.  * You will waste hours of your time trying to fix the problem. * Then they will waste your money AND time by having you ship it back so they can reformat it and ship it back to you just like you got it before. (You do get to choose how much time vs. money you get to waste on shipping costs as you are paying half of them yourself) * Then they will waste your time again as they send you back through the obstacle course. * Repeat ad nauseum or BUST.
__label__3 Great Computer but parts are flimsy  The computer works great and is really cool to dual boot with both Lion and Windows 7 - However, after just about a week, was doing research on the web and pressed down on the mouse pad and it cracked - no extra pressure, no gaming - just normal everyday use. Brought it to the local apple store and they say that it is not covered because of incidental use. Clearly this is a defect. Been an non apple guy forever, this was the first one I ever bought - not sure that I will ever buy one again.
__label__4 Was as discribed  The price was fair and the product was as described. It was shipped without a tracking number but arrived .on the date that it was promised. The box was damaged but the computer was wrapped so well that it was fine. It was also wrapped in a static wrap to prevent any problems and worked fine when I plugged it in out of the box. Wish it came with a manual , first apple computer.
__label__5 Great Little Laptop!  I have had my Eee PC 2G Surf for 2 weeks now including traveling time with it.  Works great.  Be sure to buy a good sized SD card for holding any files (docs, pics, etc) you wish to store. There's not much internal drive space left after the pre-loaded OS and apps.  I keep a 4G HC SD card in the slot and have plenty of storage.  I carry a spare usb mouse. The touchpad is just a bit confining for most surfing.  Just personal preference, though.  Everything works great on this little thing.  My kids have dubbed it "BLT" - Barbie Lap Top.  Feels GREAT to be liberated from Microsoft.
__label__5 Greatest laptop ever  I received my laptop very quickly. The process was very smooth.  I will not hesitate to purchase anything from them in the future. Thanks!
__label__3 work only 6 month
__label__5 A fantastic machine!  I highly recommend this machine. I primarily use it for programming industrial equipment and it handles their unique software easily without locking-up. The screen is bright, the various ports available on all sides is handy and the battery life is OK.
__label__3 Really solid windows XP laptop, ver outdated now.
__label__4 Toshiba Laptop  The laptop was a little larger and heavier than I thought it would be, but for the price I paid, it was a bargain.  The volume control is funny since it does not stop turning when full or min.  It keeps turning so you don't know if you have reached full volume.  Value wise, this is a great machine and if the build quality is what Toshiba has maintained in the past, this is a great machine to own. Time will tell. The amount of memory and the size of the hard drive should keep the machine running fast and allow plenty of storage for a long time to come.  The screen is very bright and readable.  Keyboard is good too.  This is my first experience with Vista and despite all the negatives I have heard about Vista, it seems to be a pretty good OS.  Weight was the only drawback in my mind.
__label__3 Good stuff but....  Well, it's cheaper than you get it from bestbuy or apple official. But my battery was rotten when i just got it and it only could last no more than 3 hours browsing the news. If i watch movie, then it sucked. Idk why.
__label__1 Bought on December 2012. Dead on August 2013.  I purchased this for my son on December of 2012 as a Christmas present. By August the machine shut down and will no longer power up. The diagnosis is a failed Logic Board. Paid $400.00 for a computer that lasted 8 months... Contacted the seller for assistance and not responding. I recommend you search the tech forums prior to making a purchase of one of these Macs. Not a good product and expensive to repair.
__label__5 Great macbook!  I have upgraded the RAM to 8GB (maxed out), replaced hard drive with 256GB SSD right after I received this from amazon.  Added boot camp with windows 8 OS and that boots up fast as well.  Screen is bright and clear.  Sometimes the fan make noise when I play games or running video/photo editor which is normal as the video card heats up when using heavy graphics program.  Keyboard is soft and very comfortable.  Trackpad is very useful as there's an ability to zoom in/out.
__label__3 Decent Laptop  Excellent price for all the good features of the laptop including the faster processor, RAM etc. I just wasn't happy with the screen ,a little too glossy maybe for me- I'm not that good looking so I didn't wana see my reflection :p LOL , but otherwise a very good product. I returned it and Amazon gave a quick refund and excellent customer service.
__label__3 Dell D620 Laptop  For the most part I am pleased with my purchase.  I realize buying refurbished there will be some issues.  I was able to use it right out of the box.  The disc drive audio needs repair.  Other then that it works good.
__label__1 The keyboard needs to be fix!!  Mine has arrived today. It looks great but the keyboard is a problem. It's very noisy and made form cheap material. I am going to send it back and will order a better netbook for the same price!!
__label__5 I love it!  I love this little machine! I'm hardly a techie, so I'll leave it to others to comment on the very stable Linux operating system, but as an everyday user here's what I like:   The screen is bright and easily read in sunlight, indoors, whatever   The 8G hard drive is tiny by today's standards but more than enough for everyday non-technical uses.   It comes preloaded with OpenOffice software, a PDF reader, spreadsheet software, etc.--really everything you need for everyday use.   It's very, very fast with plug in or wireless internet access  Weighing in at a shade over 2lbs. with battery, it fits in a small backpack, large purse, etc. The compact black neoprene case is more than enough protection, but the power charger and mouse are carried separately. I carried it around Europe for a couple of weeks no problem.  The only negatives are a smallish screen that cuts off some windows so you have to scroll horizontally at times. The screen size is dictated by two one inch wide speakers, one on each side of the screen. I wouldn't be surprised if future models downsize the speakers. Also, the keyboard is pretty small--it's fine for kids and adults with smallish hands like me; if this is a concern try it out before you buy.  The biggest plus of all is PRICE! I am happy to trade off super-duper game playing, loading up with a lot of music, etc. for portability and affordability. This probably wouldn't be someone's main computer, but as a very portable second machine with basic high quality capability, it's a winner.
__label__4 Warning about labelflash  I love my present Toshiba Satellite, which I use for everything (phone, tv, work, school, etc.), so I ordered this Satellite as an exciting upgrade.  I use Lightscribe a lot for labeling my cdr's and dvdr's, and I thought "Labelflash" was the same thing.  If this is important to you, you should know that it's not the same thing -- like VHS and Betamax, they are competing standards.  Unfortunately, since Labelflash is pretty rare, the blanks are around 3x the price of Lightscribe blanks, and are only available at a handful of on line vendors.  In addition, Labelflash uses the dvd laser so there are no cdr labelflash media.  I found out just in the nick of time and cancelled my order.  But if labeling your media with something other than a Sharpie isn't important to you, then don't worry about it.
__label__2 Crash and burn  Looked great and played nice the first day.  Installed ubuntu 11.10 along with latest firmware.  The next day I decided to install over everything including the windows partition with just ubuntu and the laptop kept reporting an error reading from the livecd.  I ran a memtest and errors came up right away!  The ram either went bad or the solder points weakened; the laptop did have a some moments where the fan spun high to dissipate the heat but I don't know if there's a correlation.
__label__3 Don't buy a refurb  I read all kinds of great reviews about Macbook Pro's and don't get me wrong I think it is a great computer but I wouldn't recommend buying a refurb. I read the statement on apples site stating that refurbs are totally tested out at the factory and pass all kinds of quality checks before they are sent back out. I don't have a non-refurb Macbook Pro to compare it to so I can't say for sure if they gave the same quirks. Problems: #1 Sometimes the computer does not recognize the first key that is struck, this happens quite often when I go to enter a password and it is pretty annoying. #2 The screen will sometimes not come back on at all from sleep mode and I have to reset the computer #3 The front right of the case for the DVD drive is bent and prevents disks from ejecting properly, I have to hold a screwdriver or another solid object into the slot to get a disk to eject. If I do not the disk hits the inside of the slot and goes back into the drive. It has separated from the bottom of the case. #4 The hinge where the screen connects seems a little bent and the computer will not close properly. #5 Mac OS X 10.4 came loaded, 10.5 was not in the box. I had to pay $10 for Apple so ship it to me. *not a big deal*  I bought the book right before I went overseas (I am in the Army) and did not realize all of these problems until after I left. Basically what I am saying is spend the extra dough and get yourself a brand new computer. I am stuck with my screwed up Mac and unfortunately I am in a location where I can't return it (so goes the life).  Other then that it is a great computer, very fast and runs circles around by Acer Laptop.  The heat is an issue, but I bought a cooling pad and my legs no longer get toasted.
__label__3 Overall it meets my requirements and I am satisfied.  Pretty good. It does everything I need it too. I can write, use WIFI, and the battery works. Small flaws that don't bother me are the case has a little crack in it, and I didn't realize I was buying a Dell 505 until I went back and looked at the details, but I should have read more carefully the individual description.
__label__2 Bunk laptop from my experience.  So I picked up this bad boy in September hoping to get deep into PC gaming with a laptop powerhouse that could run almost any game I wanted on medium-high settings. Here's what happened:  Out of the box, the first laptop was a dud. It would turn on, but the screen was just dead. Keyboard lit up, it made noise, but no screen. No luck with HDMI cable to a TV either. I sent it into ASUS for repairs (should have sent it back to Amazon for an exchange!) but I had my working laptop back in my possession a week or so later. 2 months pass, this beauty is ran Skyrim on high settings flawlessly. All of the sudden, the same problem starts happening again. So I contact ASUS who says I can send it in for repairs again (is that some sort of joke? You didn't fix it, guys) or contact the retailer. So I contact Amazon.  After a few attempts, my case gets sent to a supervisor and he express ships me a new laptop. ~Two days later it comes in the mail. This one is just dead. Won't boot, nothing. I tried using my other battery, only AC plugged in, nothing at all.  I think ASUS just messed up a bit on this model. DO NOT BUY IT. Many other people have had my same experience, this model is a DUD.
__label__5 Best Computer I have ever owned  Macintosh has done an excellent job. This is my first Mac after having owned systems with Windows since the days of Windows 3.1. The Mac OS is extremely intuitive and operates quickly. My main reason for not purchasing a Mac over the years has been the price difference. I would have to admit now that you get what you pay for and my experience will lead me to replace other PC's in my home with Macs.
__label__4 My little wonder is finally in my hands!  I have waited for a long time to be able to buy a Mac, and this is my final veredict:  1. First of all, the Superdrive is absoulutely necessary if you wanna back up your hard disk or big files... it's a little slow and bored to burn a lot of CD's with 700 MB, instead of a big DVD with 4,7 GB of capacity.  2. The Intel-Based system is very fast, have a extremely quick start, and native software runs perfectly.  3. The Intel Core 2 Duo is better than his first version. The Core 2 Duo, works colder, and doesn't have problems of unexpected shutdown. Very solid.  4. The space in gigabytes of Apple software and applications it's simply a hassle, that's why I buyed this computer with a 80 GB hard disk, and when you open your laptop the first time, you can check with horrour only 56 GB available!! That's because you can see a lot of unnecessary Apple software that uses a total of 17 GB of your precious hard disk space. The solution? I re-installed Mac OSX from the DVD, erasing the whole hard disk, and simply I "personalized" what software I really need to use, so, I unchecked all the unecessary language packs, printer for all drivers, garage band, and some useless software, and finally, I get a lovable 3,5 GB Mac OSX and a 70 GB free... perfect.  5. Mag-safe technology, simply comfortable.  6. The 13" with 1280 x 800 resolution, it's very bright, clear and you can "see" everything.  I recommend this computer for people who wants an easy-to-use system, and enjoy it without thinking in virus, patches and worms like another operating systems.
__label__1 Never again  Received late and broken
__label__4 My new pc  Me gusto mucho mi nueva pc... Estoy muy contenta con ella. Tan solo tengo como queja un sonido que emite un poco fuerte cuando no esta conectada a la electricidad, pero de resto es una muy buena maquina, muy completa a un precio bastante razonable.
__label__3 Getting rid of the hissing noise  I bought this computer back in April of 2010, and I have to say, the computer is pretty good. Even after about 7 months, the computer still starts up and shuts down quickly.  As for those who have encountered the hissing noise, I have a solution that will get rid of the noise (it was annoying for me through the headphones, especially).  In the bottom right corner of the desktop, right-click on the sound and click "Playback devices." Then right-click (or double-click) on Speakers and click "Properties." Then go to the Levels tab, go down to "PC Speaker," and click on the little blue speaker button to mute, and then turn the knob all the way down just for good measure.  Then click Ok.
__label__5 Go Mac and never go back!  I converted a few years back and now have been changing family over too.  We couldn't be happier to be away from the nightmare that is Windows.  The one slight hickup I have with this Macbook is it has a slightly defective trackpad button.  But nothing a visit to the Genius Bar can't fix.
__label__2 It's on the jittery side  Got mine for a great deal at a box store a couple of days ago, but might take it back in the end.  The mousepad is sooo sensitive, it makes the cursor jump around all over when you are typing...so there you are typing an email and boom...where'd the cursor go?  It's two lines up typing in the middle of a different sentence.  And it did this over and over and over.  I have an old Dell laptop with the same style mouse and it never does that. Otherwise I like it so far, but a very basic thing like that gets annoying very quicly, so if you get one...check out that issue.
__label__2 The DVD drive won't eject after software download is complete.  The DVD drive won't eject after software download is complete.  I am basically stuck.... Can't get it out. Please advise....
__label__4 Best value for the price  This model had the best configuration for its price at the time I researched laptops in early November. The only downside I have found so far is the short battery life (2 hours) and the tinny sounding speakers.  The touch pad is a bit erratic too but that could be just because I'm used to a mouse.  This is my first laptop and I am very happy with it.
__label__3 Is this normal?  I purchased this and received today.  I am not sure if the unit is defective.  When I click on random tab to go to different pages on Safari, the browser shows black screen with part of blocks showing text/images.  This has already happened 5 times  today which can be quite annoying.
__label__2 Laptop looks great! But it Keeps turning off by itself  The item was delivered on time. Laptop looks great! I will buy from the seller again. Great Job!
__label__1 Where is my computer  my son's Christmas ruined because of you Where is my COMPUTER I will not give you guys  a good review until you give me my laptop!!!PRONTO!!!
__label__1 Can't Use It and Amazon Won't Let Me Sell It  I bought this nearly a year ago, figuring something small and portable might be useful for taking notes and jotting down ideas when travelling.  Unfortunately the keyboard is much too small.  I kept trying to work around but finally gave up.  Only to discover Amazon won't let me sell it used on Amazon.  Apparently they only let "specially approved" dealers sell some things.  So Don't Buy It If You Are Not Sure You Will Want To Keep It.  Some things like the small keyboard are not obvious from the web - borrow someone else's or buy it from someone with an extended return policy.
__label__4 Great Machine But Beware...  I bought this new and have had a tough time with it largely in part because I uploaded a back up software called "Bounceback Express" for my portable external storage hard drive. It is software that comes with most external hard drives made bu SEAGATE and SMARTDISK. DO NOT put this software into your mac it is like a virus and can scramble the keyboard and slow down the machine immensely.  I sent my MacBook Pro back to apple twice and they gutted, but could not figure out the problem until recently. Great customer service through Apple and it is in no way their fault.  Also, it is very important you make sure you get the new battery after the 2006 Sony recall. The warranty is great though for a year so they will replace it free if it is faulty.  I would definately get the memory upgrade. All in all I would buy it again and I am happy to be done with that evil Bounceback express software.
__label__2 Decided to return  I like the feel of the keyboard, and the machine feels solid. But I had to force shutdown at least six times in the first three days. It seemed to really get hung up during shutdown and start up and sometimes would take more than 10 minutes to do either. Performance with simple actions (e.g., bringing up windows explorer or my computer) was unpredictable. Sometimes it would slow way down. It's entirely possible that it was just this machine that was defective. But I returned it and bought a Toshiba with nearly the same specs (just smaller) and it is much quicker and smoother.
__label__4 Better than I expected  Just got it a few days ago, but so far so good. It was in great condition for a  refurb, no problems with the hardware or software. All in all I would purchase another one.
__label__4 I give this a four becaus the quality of the laptop its self is not that great but is very easy to mange with and once you start using it more and more you get more accustomed to using it. Overall  I highly suggest on buying it if you cant afford the newer one .
__label__5 Fantastic Product...with one minor drawback  I bought this product for my wife (she is in sales) and she loves it.  The only drawback I can find deals with my complete ignorance of the operating system (Linux).  The system runs great...but I have no idea how to update it or even link it to my home network (windows).  Each time I try to read up on it...I come away more confused.  Don't get me wrong..the spreadsheet, and word processing is extrememly similar to Excel and Word.  Easily saved and sent wirelessly through email to our home computer.  The thing works seamlessly...but as soon as I try to deviate from those simple task I run head first into not being familiar with Linux at all.  This is really a criticism that deals with my lack of knowledge...but if I had realized how hard it would be to run (or not be able to run) and executable file...I would have opted to have it pre-loaded with windows XP.  For now...she will keep using it (and loving it) and I will have to hope I can find time to figure out the operating system.
__label__2 Avoid this model  The MacBook Pro has many issues which is why I am rating it at 2 stars. There are much better laptops available. Be aware the price offered here at Amazon by third party dealers is not the cheapest available. Apple sells it for less than the current price shown. The strongest thing going for the system is it's operating system which gives a brief breath of fresh air from the coldness found in Windows. There is also a strong community of users who will help you out and a friendly customer service team.  The main issues are a screen which is horrific. Apple can no longer be known for graphics. The maximum resolution found on the screen is less than other models sold by their competitors. This is how this system was designed. Investigate.  The MacBook Pro screens have a defect affecting most of the production currently. The lower 1/3 of the screen will have a yellowish/golden hue. The very top of the monitor has a 1mm bright white line. The tones from top to bottom are inconsistent. The screens background helps to mask the problem but you will see it if you ever do any work with the system. The viewing angle is very narrow. If your head leaves a 4 inch box the screen is almost unreadible and will be golden in color. This is due to the "LED" backlighting system. Investigate.  If you are still intent on an Macbook look at the 17 inch model. You will notice the 17" is the most commonly reviewed model because the other ones will be horribly received. It does not use the LED backlighting and the maximum resolution is higher.  The second main issue is something Mac users are referring to as "Kernel panic". It is the same thing as Microsoft's notorius "blue screen of death"except the cause is the hardware. Should your system have "kernel panic" you will have a locked up, unusable system. The work will have gone unsaved and you will be out of the notebook for 3 weeks as they repair the brand new system. Investigate this further.  Yes, stick a fork in it. This model is a turkey.
__label__2 Fine for about 6 months...  Had gotten a long term job assignment out of state and bought this laptop for use in my hotel room.  I haven't really used it without plugging it in.  I would have to say on average during the week its on about 4-6 hours a day and on the weekends between 6 - 10 hrs a day. I also travel every other weekend and basically it doesnt get used at all... So It worked well.. nothing outstanding but acceptable. At about 6 months after being on for a couple of hours it would just shut down - screen would go black then fan and motor would just  go off.  Id let it cool down then restart and most times it would be fine for awhile.  It began happening more often so I bought one of those dual fan laptop stands to keep it cooler. That seems to help.  At about 13 months ( how convienient for DELL) the thing started shutting down after 15 minutes - fan or no fan.... IM in the process now of trying to find out what the problem is... Did the diagnostics and its states everything is fine....Overall im just dissapointed that after 14 months Im already having issues.... Just real tired of us all becoming a "throw away society" I mean should i spend 250.00 to get the thing fixed or toss it....
__label__3 Problems with wifi connections  I wish i could keep this notebook. It seems well made, is  powerful and most importantly OS X is a much better thought out OS than Vista and generally better supported than Linux.  It has a few shortcomings such as just 2 USB ports, and it gets too hot due to the metal frame. I could live with these but I have struggled fruitlessly to get decent wifi internet speeds.  (My friend's Thinkpad is 10 times as fast to download and render pages on my wifi system side by side.  Ive spent ages searching the web for the solution and found loads of people have similar problems (Just Google for "macbook pro slow wifi connection" if you don't believe me.  There doesnt seem to be one  single problem and people have come up with a range of solutions.  Some people  say its WEP keys  that are the problem, other that its something to do with the N wifi card. I do get geat speeds if i take it to the Apple store and use their non encrypted Wifi connection. Probably I could eventually get it to work, but I want this laptop to travel around the world with so i cant afford to take  kiyt thats going to take 6 hours of headaches to get cproperly working each time I get to a place.  The other  issue is working within a mixed Mac/Windows enironment.  Boot  camp and parallels are very helpful, but I still have encountrred annoying issues  eg that it doesnt like NTFS formatted disks, that it tries to format Ipods wit MAc  filing system so that they cannot be used on PCs  without special downloads.  Bottom line its  a lot of hassle.  If you live in a completely Mac environment than this is  a great laptop, if  you want to interact with a wide range of non mac equipment, it may be  more  trouble thatn its worth.
__label__4 A lot of value for the price, says a Mac user  Ok, so I had to hold my nose when buying a Windows machine. But as a secondary system, this SONY nVGN365e is a pretty good deal. Outstanding screen display and an elegant simplicity to the keyboard area that gives it a clean look, no gizmo's and BS.  I have looked at tons of laptops, and most are cheap looking and cheesy...someone's tacky idea of impressing a user.  Not this one. In fact, its exterior styling seems nabbed from the Mac Book Pro.  I'm primarily a Mac user with an iMac desktop as my main machine. I wanted a laptop as a secondary, but found the Mac Book - while very cool-  to be too small for my hands and typing habits, and the Mac Book Pro, well, it's simply more than I want to spend. I shopped for three months until buying this SONY during a Labor Day markdown. (I have since seen the same one marked even lower).  I did the usual junkware uninstall day one. There wasn't an overload, but enough to slow things down.  Speed seems fine with 1 GB, but I may double it. No heat issues, and it's quieter than quiet. Only the touchpad makes racket, but I'm old school and a habitual mouse user anyway.  I do most of my work in Word and otherwise am on the Internet. For documents, I write using MS-Works, then xfer the file over to the iMac desktop (which has MS-Office for Mac) for finalization. A kind of reversal in machine roles, in this era of Apple dusting Mr. Softie.  How Vista goes, and how the machine behaves over time...can't say. If I have any concern, it would be security....every Windows machine I've owned has been vulnerable and subject to trash-out. They say the security is better now. We'll see. Overall, a good buy...a 4 rather than 5 because it's a MS product.
__label__5 ASUS 4G SURF  A great mini computer.  Just don`t get the white one because:  My son purchased a black one and I went for the white one. All was well until he said let,s put in a Gig of memory for optimal performance so lo and behold the black model has A handy door for this purpose but the white one must be disassembled to insert memory.  If you turn your Asus into a brick in the process you,ll be sorry. Don,t attempt unless you are computer savy. Linux works very well and very fast. Get yours today!  docjim
__label__2 Stunning Zenbook ships with different SSD and Touchpad variants. Getting a right combination is like winning the lottery.  I received the Zenbook a week ago and have the following to report, addressing most buyers concerns (including myself) when wanting to purchase the Zenbook:  I do hope you find it useful - please vote this up if you did, to inform prospective buyers. Thanks!  Physical outlook: The Zenbook largely resembles the MacBook Air in terms of svelteness. Even the tapering of the chasis 17mm-3mm is the same as the MacBook. This is a good thing because the Zenbook looks better than the MacBook air. The edges look more clean cut, more industrial looking. Definitely something for the corporate board.  Keyboard: This is a hit and miss issue with many users. You either love it or hate it. I found the keyboard better than the MacBook because I could actually type faster on this laptop. 1. The keys have much lesser travel than the MacBook Air. 2. They are well spaced.  Some people were complaining about how unresponsive the keys would be. I had found that to be true when I first used the laptop, but adapted to the typing style, applying a little more pressure with each keystroke. Now I can type faster than I can with my iMac wireless keyboard! It's just a matter of getting used to.  Poor Trackpad: This is perhaps one of my most pertinent gripes about the Zenbook. The trackpad, like the keyboard is a matter of getting used to. Asus did a poor job in this aspect because they did not standardize the parts used in their Zenbook series. Some Zenbooks came with the Elan touchpad. Others came with the more inferior Sentallics branded touchpad. Both touchpads had different drivers - and performance. The sentallics version performed poorly even with updated drivers and felt like using a year 20000-esque trackpad. There was very poor control over the trackpad, it seemed to have a mind of it's own - especially when using multitouch gestures.  I managed to get the Elan trackpad, and my experience was not better off. When using two fingers on the trackpad in Opera (one finger on left click, the other to move the cursor around) the Zenbook did not recognize this even though my other finger was on the left click BUTTON. It kept recognizing this as a pinch and zoom, resizing the page I was browsing. This is irritating as I have to adapt to using the laptop with one finger. MacBook Airs don't even have a specific left click button and they don't accidentally recgnize my gestures as pinch to zoom. In this aspect, Asus has tragically failed in one of the key aspects of interaction with a laptop - the touchpad.  Slow SSD: As with the trackpad, the Zenbook shipped with two 128GB SSD variants, the slower Sandisk u100 and the faster, more superior ADATA SANDFORCE. I received the Sandisk variant and I'm seriously having buyers remorse on the purchase. Major reviewers (engadget, anandtech, pocketlint, ars technica) somehow received the superior ADATA variants as their test units, and based their judgement on the drive they received. Most buyers purchase because of the positive reviews made by them. Their reviews would have been much different with the SANDISK SSD.  What Asus did was misleading, and very inappropriate. Advertising the faster ADATA SSD's then shipping other units with the lousier Sandisk units.  The benchmarks I done using Crystal Disk Mark showed the vast difference in speeds. Below:  SANDISK Size Read Write 4K 16.92 12.49 512K 253.2 21.81****** 1GB 460.2 247.1  ADATA (Data from notebookcheck.net) SIZE Read Write 4K 26.38 51.15 512K 374.7 131.7***** 1GB 429.6 132.8  As you can see, the speeds on the ADATA is easily 6 times faster on write speeds. The 1GB is similar but for day to day usage like surfing and microsoft office, the most commonly used size is below 512K. Thus, the ADATA offers a tremendous speed increase compared to the Sandisk. As a consumer paying the same amount for a laptop, it is only fair that we receive what we expect. There should be no deviation from what Asus advertises and what we receive.  In this instance, getting a perfect Zenbook combination was like striking the lottery given the amount of permutations given. We only have a 1 in 4 chance of getting both the Elan touchpad and ADATA SSD.  Wireless Problem: Many users were facing problems with their Wireless card receiving slow speeds. An updated driver would solve the problem. I did not experience the Wifi problem and the Zenbook worked fine out of the box. I found that the weak wireless problem may be attributed to the Power Options settings. Goto power options -> change plan settings -> changed advanced power settings -> Wireless Adapter settings -> Power saving mode -> MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE.  Audio Hissing Sound: Some users complained (in the UX21 reviews) that they heard very loud hissing sounds coming out of their earphone port with earphones. I did not hear it on my unit. Perhaps he received a lemon?  In conculsion: Truth be said, I am not an Apple fan and was very happy to see such a good looking ultraportable that trumps the MacBook Air's air of sexiness. The zenbook is downright awesome to look at. The full aluminium chasis offers the kind of durability no other laptop can offer in it's class.  But with further comparison, the Apple ships with same compenents across the board. We appreciate this reliablility because we KNOW what components we are getting.  We aren't playing the lottery Asus, and this Zenbook certainly isn't my idea of a $1000 lottery ticket.
__label__1 Like a luxury car with overly tinted front windscreen!  It is very difficult to read the black letters on the bronze keyboard under normal lighting conditions. Owning this laptop is like owning a luxury car with overly tinted front window screens i.e. the tool is feature loaded but is fairly useless for everyday use. I should have read the reviews before giving my wife the go-ahead to purchase the unit. I called HP: the customer service rep also acknowledged getting lots of return/repair calls about the difficult-to-read keyboard. Go figure!  Like so many other buyers, we have returned the unit.
__label__4 Good Product  Its an Apple, I expected to give it 5 starts but this has been my most buggy software wise mac since OS9, maybe they are spending too much time on the stupid iPhone, but the current version of the OS has all my internet appps going wacky, and I get Kernel Panics every fricking week. The new LED LCD is very bright, the Battery life is better than older MBPs and its bloody fast and thats with the 2GB of 667 RAM, I wonder what it will do with 4GB of 800 RAM. I m just sorry I could not wait till October to get it with the new OS.
__label__3 Slow to service  Came with a dead battery, dealer has been slow to replace it - three weeks later a defective battery replacement was received.  So far, dealer has responded to all emails quickly, maybe it's just the holiday slowing things up.  I'll give them benefit of the doubt and hoping they make this right.  The computer is a little more banged up than I hoped for, but technically seems to be running OK.  (as long as it's plugged in)
__label__4 My dog ate my homework  Our big leonberger puppy Bronco chewed on my oldest sons Asus G1 series computer. Thus he lost his homework stored on the computer and his computer. However, this is the replacement for it, and it is a decent computer. We told Best Buy the truth and they still replaced it, which was nice of them (we had a service plan). However, I noticed that Amazon has this computer for about $100 less than Best Buy sold it for.  The specs for the laptop are very good, 3GB of RAM, 2.4MHz Intel core 2 Duo T8300 processor (fast), NVIDIA SLI Dual GeForce3 8600T GT with 512MB VRAM (a very good graphics card), 6 USB 2.0 ports, HDMI output, and 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet, Quad-band Wi-Fi LAN (we use both wireless and Ethernet), and it has a fast access (7200RPM) 320GB hard drive (and much more).  A large hard drive is nice, because the kids always run out space and I have to buy external hard drives that are a real pain to drag around on trips. Personally I am very tired of the puny 60GB and 80GB hard drives. Those hard drives I fill up in one week.  The sound is very nice, and the screen is a 17 inch high quality WSXGA (TruBrite, 1440X900), which makes the graphics look bright and clear. The DVD player is top notch, and the laptop is quiet, and it runs smoothly. The kids have used it for a while and they have tried some programs with demanding graphics like garry's mod and it still ran smoothly.  However, my son still felt that considering the great spec, programs should have loaded faster and the graphics was not as fast as he had hoped. This laptop is also quite heavy (9Lbs). So I think we got a decent deal, but not a perfect deal. Maybe Bronco should chew on some more laptops. Well nah, his homework was lost for ever and that is not good (he did not back up his hard drive for two months).
__label__3 Good but NOT great  Got this at Best Buy with the same specs as advertised here and was pleased with its graphics & performance. It doesn't contain much bloat-ware and can run more than 20 windows without slowing down. But its biggest con is the battery life and it's REALLY bad. Gateway claims it can hold a charge of 3 hours but I've witness the NV53A go as long as 2 hours maxed with settings set to Power Saver. Today my battery needs to be replaced and it didn't even last a year (only 6 months).  PROS: Can play MMORPGs, some PC games on MAX settings, gorgeous LED screen, HDMI-out, classy & durable exterior design, fast processor, fairly loud speakers, Windows 7 64 bit, big 500GB HDD, 4GB RAM, etc.  CONS: Awful battery lifespan, built-in webcam is garbage (requires good lighting source/doesn't record HD), LED has bad limited viewing angles, 256MB of ATI Mobility Radeon (hoped for at least 512MB), etc.  In conclusion, it's NOT worth the price and should be at least $399 but it's a decent capable laptop. For nearly $700 you might as well save up another $100 and get an Alienware laptop. The NV53A isn't a bad laptop but its flaws keep me from recommending this to everyone. If you decide to purchase it just don't expect the laptop to blow you away because it will disappoint. It's great for general usage but there's certainly better laptops out there.
__label__2 I hope replacement will fair better.  Network card died prior to 30 days of ownership. I hope replacement will fair better.
__label__2 Too Bad  I bought the g73jw xa1 asus laptop in beginning of dec . I have had 5 laptops since 2001 (4 hp's 1 dell )and I have to say the ASUS was the Worse laptop I have ever bought and had replaced with a 2nd one both were junk . returned both and will go back to having an HP . The asus is the only laptop I have had that didnot work straight out of the box.  I spent several days on both laptops (asus's) trying to get them to work right , buttons on left side would stop working . Lock-ups . Had to reset to factory specs to get them to work again and that would last only a couple days. I never had to do anything with the hp laptops except up grade them when the graphics cards became obsolete never had a problem , that a quick hop on the online chat couldn't take care of. Tried to get a hold of Asus , that was a waste of time getting no answers from them . Only good thing out of buying the Asus from Amazon was them giving me a refund .  So all in all , I'll stick with what I know and that is HP Laptops are great when compared to the G73JW-XA1 1 I can understand not working but when the replacement has the same problems , I wasn't going for a third one !  I do recognize that you can't be lucky all the time and understand people don't like Hp but I have never had a problem with them .  I will say say the Asus does look cool if for nothing else than a paper weight , maybe the third one might have worked I'll never know ?  Good Luck all !
__label__4 Good laptop for the price  I brought the laptop about 1 month ago. It plays DVDs well. I thought it might not considering the small video memory. As many people have pointed out it gets heated up fast. But considering that the price is less than any other laptop giving these features I am more than happy.
__label__3 It's okay! but the curse is missup  The person should have put the information in about the curse. Other than that it is okay the speed is good and virus protection is up to date.
__label__4 Good purchase, speedy shipping  Very quick shipping and a great price. Battery life is a bit unimpressive however the computer runs great and I have really enjoyed the slightly higher than integrated video card for videos and games.
__label__5 Asus Eee PC 2G  this is my 3rd Eee 7".. originally got the black 4G Surf linux which i upgraded to 1G ram, then got pink 2G Surf for girlfriend, and now white 2G Surf for Charlie in FL.  i really believe that Asus has upgraded the 2G surf very well.. originally had 256 ram and now has 512 ram which easily runs linux. also the touchpad worked flawlessly for this unit.. i had some sensitivity issues or laptop freezing with earlier units if i were not careful. this unit worked great.. never froze up or locked ever forcing a reboot...  this is a great little machine, solidly built. charlie had no problem logging into his cable network.. simply entered this password for the encryption.. am very pleased. i also bought an sd card to have some extra space
__label__3 It's okay
__label__3 Ok, if you need something for occasional use.  Note: My company gave me this laptop for work purposes. I've used it for over a month now. I didn't pay for it, so don't know what the cost of this laptop is elsewhere on the internet or in stores.  Build: Looks like a good sturdy laptop for office use. Durability wise, no problems so far. It does feel heavy for it's size though. It is ugly because it's a "business class" product and not a home or a media class product. The screen size is thicker than other laptops that you get today.  Configuration & Performance: Mine came with a Core 2 Duo, and 4 GB ram. Shipped with Windows 7 professional. So far it has handled whatever I've thrown at it quite well. I've tried a couple of videos on it, the speakers are alright. I've used it for running Visual Studio (2010) and Eclipse (Helios) and it's handled both really well. The boot up time feels a little high for the configuration, but it's not too bad.  Noise: The fans are extremely silent and not just on power save mode. I haven't heard a peep out of this laptop so far. I'm really weird about the noise factor and I have to say so far this laptop has fared well in that department. The hard drive is dead silent (as it should be!).  Keyboard & Pointer devices: The keyboard just sucks. The keys are way too soft so you don't get the feel of pressing them. Yet, they make that typing sound. Just weird. The touch-pad isn't responsive enough even after a lot of tweaking with the dell software. Neither is the pointer in between the keyboard. In fact the pointer is so weird, it registers a left click when you accidentally touch it while typing. That's really annoying when you're trying to get work done! Overall, the keyboard, the touch-pad, the pointer seem very cheap and flimsy. The behavior is erratic and I don't think it's a software issue.  Display: The brightness is fine. The "auto-brightness" is nonsense. The laptop has a light sensor which adjusts the brightness level depending on ambient light. It just doesn't work. As much as someone's shadow standing over your shoulder messes it up to a huge extent. At times there is no change in light and it still flickers. I've just turned it off. The max-brightness is bright enough for work in direct sunlight. Overall, the display is ok. Nothing to brag about, but nothing really big to complaint about either.  Adapter etc: The power brick is nice and thin and the cord has a power indicator on the tip that connects to the laptop. The problem is it stays on even when not connected to the laptop, but I guess they designed it that way so you'd know. The LEDs on the laptop aren't very bright. BUT, I find the HDD light rather annoying. It keeps flickering way too much indicating heavy disk activity even when it's just idling. This indicator shouldn't even be there IMHO. It's pointless.  One thing I like is the ability to stop the battery from charging so you can leave the laptop constantly plugged in when you want without worrying that it'll reduce the overall battery life.  Conclusion: Ok, if you want something to work with occasionally. It's not very comfortable to carry around. You might want to get a mouse and keyboard to use with this thing. I'd say this laptop is worth 500$ given what I've seen so far.
__label__4 Nice Laptop for price  I got this laptop for my sister because she's entering college, and so far she loves it. Of course like every other review, you have to play with it first. I took a lot of the bloatware out (about 3 hours of work), and installed my own software in. Then defrag the comp. For a 1.6 duo core with 1G of ram, it's surprising fast enough to do what my sister needed to do.  The wireless issue that some reviews are commenting on, she has not experienced. There's wireless internet at home, her friends house, and school, and she's able to connect to all of them with ease. It evens saves the password from the router and when the laptop picks up the signal it automatically logs her in. She loves the wireless on/off button. When she knows there's no internet available she just clicks it off and saves battery life.  This is good general everyday use laptop. It's been great for a college student. My recommendation is to upgrade the ram. 1G of ram is sufficent by all means, but you can never have enough ram. Battery life is a little short. I'm probably gonna upgrade her laptop to 2G of ram, and an extended battery. Other than that she loves it, and we highly recommmend it to anyone.
__label__5 Scream Machine at a Nice Price  *Although Amazon recommends reviews don't be too long, this is a major purchase with many things to consider and deserves an in depth review.  I have owned 4 laptops, all Dell. My current laptop is a Dell Inspiron 8600 with the then revolutionary Pentium M processor. After three years the HD is acting funny, writing occasionally corrupt files, batch processing (processor intensive) of large RAW format photo files is taking forever (even with 1.25 GB of RAM) and my 80GB hard drive which seemed so huge back then is full. So it was time for a change.  I play my games on a Play Station 3, so although this laptop is marketed as a gaming laptop its not a selling point for me. (It even has a large, removable sticker promoting a game on the keyboard) I am into digital photography and have to process larger numbers of RAW format files into JPEGs. I also am into HD video. I have Blu-Ray covered with my PS3, so getting a laptop with an HD-DVD player that had HDMI out to play on my HD TV would cover all HD DVD formats. BTW, Netflix now ships both Blu-Ray and HD-DVD formats of movies if they are available. Lastly, I like to surf the Net and listen to MP3s. The large screen makes surfing sweet and this laptop has FIVE harmon/kardon speakers so MP3s sound GREAT.  So based on what I use my laptop for, my buying criteria was:  -HD DVD player (preferably a SuperMulti)to watch HD DVDs and burn mps and photo and video DVDs -Minimum 2 GB of Ram which helps speed up processing times -HD drive of at least 120 GB for large amounts of photo and mp3 files -Duo processor with at least 1.8 GHZ to speed up batch processing of photo files -SD card reader for easy transfer of my photos files from my camera.  I looked first, of course, at Dell, then looked here at Amazon. For the same features, the x205 beats the price of comparable Dell models by a couple hundred. It also was in the same price range as 15" laptops with the features I wanted and since this was not a laptop I was traveling with, size was not an issue. And yes, in this case, bigger is better! Also, Toshiba has a good name and there were several good reviews here so I took the plunge.  This is my first computer with Vista and I was a little leary since all my programs are for XP. This is similar to my hesitation to jump to XP from ME and from Windows 98 to ME, but I have not had any serious problems yet. Many programs have Vista driver updates and Vista has the Windows Compatibility program that helps older programs that aren't working right on Vista to run correctly. Vista has a much more advanced look then XP, its like going from Star Trek to Star Trek The Next Generation. This is especially evident with the x205's biometic reader where you can setup locking the computer as well as logging into your secure websites with only a swipe of a finger.  This computer is blazing fast for everything I am using it for. Vista ranks system components performance from 1 to 5.9 with 5.9 being the highest. The rank shows how well a component works with Vista and is called the Windows Experience Index. The x205 overall Index is 4.8, which is computed by the LOWEST component score. The graphics card on the x205 scored a 5.9.  The screen is the best laptop screen I have ever seen, by far the brightest. It does have the shiny screen cover, not the dull covers that all the previous laptops I have owned had. So, it does suffer from glare, but it is brighter and has higher contrast then any screen I have seen. HD content on it is GORGEOUS! Going through the Windows Media Center setup you use an HD movie to set the screen up and your jaw will drop at how good it looks.  The biometric reader is a little fussy but I would rather swipe my finger a couple of times then try and remember a password and type it in.  I have watched a regular DVD on the player and it looks great. I have burned a DVD with the player and it worked fine, but it is not the fastest DVD burner available. I guess being able to read and write in so many formats (DVD+,DVD-,DVD-RAM and both formats of dual layer DVDs and CDs) you have to sacrifice speed.  The speakers sound great with little or no distortion. They are moderately loud, but a review I saw recently made it sound like they were much louder.  There is an issue with keyboard. The keys can be easily popped off. I have not done it yet, I have read about it and I can see where that can happen. I am ordering the&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Toshiba-PA3611U-1ETC-Silicone-Keyboard-Protector/dp/B000TMI1E6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Toshiba PA3611U-1ETC Silicone Keyboard Protector</a>&nbsp;available on Amazon in hopes it will prevent that from happening. (Works great! Only thing is that hair clings to it like steel to a magnet)  The touch pad is unique in that it has buttons on it for the sound, mail, and programmable areas for starting up programs. You touch an area in the upper right of the pad to turn on the functions and when you do the pad illuminates blue. You have to get used to not hitting it while using it. The whole pad also feels a little off centered too far to the left. But, this laptop is so big you probably with be using a mouse anyway. It has 4 USB 2.0 ports on the right side so adding a mouse is no problem.  Pros: Price vs Features (although it has gone up since I bought it), Processor Speed, HD Display Screen, HD Size, SuperMulti DVD player, Biometric reader, 6 USB 2.0!!!, all ports are on front and sides for easy access, attractive case, numeric pad on keyboard, rich sounding speakers, runs cooler on the bottom then my Dell laptops (heat is vented to the sides)  Cons:  Weight, AC Adapter converter is the size of a brick!, price of buying a second adapter is expensive.  UPDATE:  A couple of things. First, the AC adapter is working intermittently. I contacted support and they are shipping another out, about 6 business days. Kinda surprised it is going to take that long when it only took 2 days to get the computer.  Next. I bought Transformers in HD DVD. I searched several stores before finding it so I could not wait to watch it. I put it in the laptop, and the software (Toshiba HD DVD Player) would not play it! I called support and they directed me to this laptops download page on the Toshiba Support website. I upgraded to the latest Toshiba HD DVD player listed. Well it still did not work so they opened a case file on it. The laptop is supposed to ship with Intervideo WinDVD 8. I think I deleted it when I was deleting the bloatware when I first got the laptop since I found an incomplete folder on the computer. Support told me I need to RESTORE my computer, ie delete everything, to get to the original state and have WinDVD 8 installed. Well I continued to search for an alternative. First, I put the restore disc in and while you can chose to restore programs, the long list did not include WinDVD 8. Then I found not listed on my models support page, but on the overall Toshiba support download homepage is a later model of the Toshiba HD DVD Player software that states you need to use it to play some HD DVDs made after Sept 17. I loaded it and found that while I can watch movies hitting the play icon on the player, I cant use the mouse on any of the screen icons. So, I can watch a movie WITHOUT all the extras HD DVD has! I decided to not restore my computer because if I do and this early version of WinDVD 8 does not play newer HD DVDs either, I will have to call someone to replace the window I will throw this laptop through. I am going to have to bite the bullet and cough up $70-$100 for HD DVD software. Really sucks.  Also, when I did get the HD DVD player to play a movie, I used the HDMI out to connect to my big screen TV and got an error message about external monitors were not supported. I don't know if this is software or not.  Because of this I am lowering this to 4 stars. Also I have not tried copying from an SD card yet and don't know if the reader supports SD HC cards of 2GB and bigger. Hopefully it does or if not, that is another strike against it as large capacity cards are dropping in price everyday.  UPDATE #2:  I ended up getting Nero's HD DVD/Blu-Ray plug-in since I already had Nero 7. At $25 it was the cheapest, and since its a download (although its like 188MB!) the fastest solution. However, I still can't click onto the on screen icons. But, Nero allows me to go through the chapters so I have "blind" access to the extras. I also tried the HDMI out and it doesn't work with Nero either. sigh. Real bummer that I can't find a way to watch on my big screen TV.  UPDATE #3  Tosiba's newest version of its HD DVD player software does work with the DVD onscreen menus. You have to use key commands, however, to get it to work. Only the play icon seems to work on the player control panel. The Esc key brings up the DVD's menu and you navigate using the arrow keys and hit Enter to execute menu commands. Also, Toshiba shipped my replacement power cord (only the half with the converter box) overnight, not ground as I was told on the phone. Now the only thing I have to tackle is getting HD DVDs to play via the HDMI out.  UPDATE #4 (most likely the last) I got the HDMI out to work and play an HD DVD movie on my TV. I used the latest software version of the Toshiba HD DVD player. It wasn't working before because for whatever reason it won't let you display the movie on both the laptop and the TV so you have to either right click the desktop and go into the NVIDIA controls and choose only one display and pick your TV from the pulldown list or use FN F5 which brings the same thing up. The picture (Transformers) looked great so I am pleased. I have an older TV with DVI so I have to use a DVI-HDMI adapter and the headphone out for sound, but it works. I imagine the digital out on the front of the laptop could be used with a surround system, although I am not sure and its a mini plug out, not an RCA or optical out like I am used to seeing.
__label__3 Not happy with Customer Service  My Acer Aspire one is less than a year old and the screen went out.  There was no physical damage or dropped.  They would replace it for $100 (after I sent it in with shipping costs).  I bought a new one for $40 and easily did it myself.  I was disappointed that the screen went out less than a year and they would not do anything about it.
__label__2 POS TBH.  This is by far my least favorite laptop I've owed (and I am including the 300 dollar PCs that I had in college).  It takes FOREVER to load from sleeping or when shut down. Seriously 10-15 minutes to start running like normal (sometimes because it needs to catch up on iMessages, or emails, or whatever tf else it has on its to-do list).  I had an air that crapped itself last year and replaced it with this; it was a huge mistake. The air was wonderful, worked lightning fast and never had any issues at all. This guy just is NOT doing it for me.  /cry.
__label__3 Returned because I could not download XCode on it :(
__label__3 weird pricing  I was ready to buy this laptop a few weeks ago, when it was listed for $950.  The next day, the computer was unavailable.  Then it was listed for around $1100, then over $1200, then unavailable, then back to around a thousand, and now it's almost $1300.  At $950, it seemed like a good deal.  At $1300, it's not.
__label__2 Too Bad  It was unfortunate but the computer had problems from day one.  It had a small window that came up every time the system was booted for no apparent reason, couldn't find me, fan made noise, and other issues.  It appeared to be a good computer and fast, couldn 't keep it because of problems.  Ordinarily Amazon has provided me with great products every time.  Computer has been returned and my money was refunded.
__label__5 This pc is Great i have been using it at work for over a year
__label__1 Very old  Too old to even update. Waste of money
__label__3 do not buy  great computer. had for 2 years. with windows 7 ultimate. its ran so fast for 2 years. still runs super fast. great graphics. good amount of memory and ram.  bad---  had to replace battery before year was up. then again, 5 months later. now i have 2. gets very hot screen flickers - which it says is an ATI driver issue but when i update it didn't work. -   which lead to where i am now. the screen went out. had to reload new version of windows because that screen problem, causes HD to crash. now im stuck on reloading windows.  wondering what to do.  dont buy it unless your only going to use it for 2 years.
__label__2 I need a option for latinamerica Warrantly  i like know If Amazon have a option for Latinamerica Warrantly, My HP is in Colombia and this have a damage in your memory. The warranty is Only in USA, and mi HP not have warrantly in mi country. Wath option I have in this case?
__label__1 screen dosnt work  well i got the computer and powered it up but the screen never came on it must have gotten damaged during shipping or something i really don't know how good of a computer it is cause i cant use but im defintly going to get it fixed cause i beleive it would be a very good computer
__label__5 Apple Bandwagon!  Two weeks ago my Dell died and I purchased the Apple MacBook Pro.  I honestly did not think that there would be such a major difference in the two, but boy oh boy do I feel like a kid in the candy store.  I am sold!  I have officially joined the Apple Bandwagon.
__label__2 Ya'll don't have garageband but other than that, its all good
__label__1 Junk  Junk
__label__3 poor battery  I was so excited to receive my HP, however the battery would not hold a charge for very long.  I returned the product.
__label__4 mc's macbook pro  value:  overpriced screen quality:  excellent altho small for old eyes quality:  excellent os:  mac, need i say more?  (haven't tried linux); this computer is working while my pc is thinking about it browser:  safari - needs work, hangs as in bugs! speed:  smokes pc's' recommend:  yes buy again:  yes, especially, if cheaper!
__label__5 Wow, what a ride  Let me start off by saying that this laptop is phenomenal. If you get a unit that functions out of the box, then you will be one happy customer, I guarantee it. But be forewarned - if your unit does not function out of the box, you are in for a long ride. I bought this unit about a month ago, and from the moment I opened the box it was defective. (The laptop froze after 10 minutes on battery power.) I sent it in for repair twice. The first time it was not fixed. The second time it was returned fixed, but with the MSBlaster virus and porn on its memory stick. As you can imagine, I wasn't in the greatest of moods. At this point I am in negotations with Sony to get a new, better unit. So all is well that ends well I suppose. Why do I rank this laptop 5 stars after this experience? Well, I can separate the superb characteristics of the laptop from the wretched characteristics of Sony's repair shop. Amazingly light, this laptop will never be a burden to you. If I wanted, I could hold it in the palm of my right hand while typing with my left and never feel the pain of a 7 lb deadweight in my hand. 4.3 lbs is definitely nice. And the power! 2 Ghz of Pentium muscle, 512 MB of RAM, all tucked into a svelte case with a 12" LCD monitor and built-in wireless. This laptop is perfect for the on-the-go business types, or students. It is the perfect machine if you get a working one. But be prepared for a fight when you get a wormy apple.
__label__5 Must Have HDCP Compliant HDMI Device  If you want to hook this up to a TV and watch BD movies, the TV must have a High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) compliant HDMI connection. Apparently this is a secret because you can't find this on Amazon's description or on Sony's website specifications. It also seems to be quite difficult to determine if a TV is HDCP compliant, so call the manufacturer if you can't find it in a specification sheet or in the manual. An external computer monitor must also be HDCP compliant for BD movies to play. If you watch a BD movie through the HDMI connection, you can't have the laptop display on simultaneously.  I don't see this in the description on Amazon, but I bought mine direct from Sony and it came with an external ATI TV Wonder Digital Cable Tuner that accepts a cable card. You can watch HDTV broadcasts on the laptop with it.  I think this is a great laptop.
__label__2 Nice laptop, but beware of poor construction quality and bad customer service  I'll get straight to the point. Pros: 1. It is thin and really light, just like they advertise it. 2. Performance is what you would expect from this kind of a laptop. It was handling everything I have no problem. It was even playing my mp4 1080p movie.  Cons: 1. It came preinstalled with tons of junk from Lenovo. I had to reinstall Windows from scratch as soon as I got it. I bough many laptops before but this one came with exceptional amount of trial software and junk from Lenovo. 2. I bought my laptop with Vista and "free" upgrade to Windows 7. When I called Lenovo and asked about the upgrade they told me that I have to pay shipping and handling  ($17) for them to ship me a CD. When I said that I don't even have a CD rom on this laptop, customer service rep had no clue what to say back. By the way, get ready for customer service located in China. The guy on the phone clearly had no idea. 3. Now to my biggest problem. Two month after I bought my laptop, I was removing and placing back a battery. When I was placing it back to the case something snapped. Apparently it was a plastic hinge that was holding my battery. Now my battery would not hold inside the case. I called Lenovo, and they told me to send laptop back to them, and they would determine if my repair is covered under warranty. 5 days later I got a call from them telling me that my repair would not be covered and I have to pay...$167 dollars to replace this part. Keep in mind that I paid $450 dollars for the whole laptop. So they wanted third of that to replace one plastic part. I called them back, and spoke with customer service rep, then a supervisor, but had absolutely no luck. At the end supervisor said that the best he can do is to send me to another Customer Service department that handles this kind of cases. I said fine. He said, they will contact you in...5-7 business days. This was after I did not have my laptop for 5 days already. I was beyond mad, and told them to send me my laptop back. Now I have a scotch tape in the back of my brand new laptop.  Conclusion: I hope you have better experience with this laptop and with Lenovo in general, but beware, it has poor quality and poor Customer Service.
__label__5 Best computer I have ever had. Now that I have a Mac, I won't go back.
__label__3 Would keep it, but with more powerful processor  In general I liked this netbook: quality, features, feel and appearance. If you want to have 2-3 windows open at max then you can stay with it, but if you expect something more powerful then look somewhere else.  The weakest part is AMD C-50 processor. It is loaded about 50% without any action from user. The Windows Experience Index: Processor 2.8, RAM 4.9, Graphics 4.1, Gaming/3D Graphics 5.5 and HDD 5.8. Increasing RAM to 4GB will improve multitasking, but still not at the desirable level. It is weak for HD video as well, so you will not be able to watch decent video on it either.  If the system used dual core Pentium with 2GHz, it would be an adequate computer with enough power and small size. I returned it as I wanted something more modern regarding power experience.
__label__1 So I decided not sending the computer back and put it in the garbage.  The mac didn't work and according to the description it was supposed to work with an external screen, and it did not. So I request a devolution and they were charging me a restocking fee, and I also have to pay the shipping. So I decided not sending the computer back and put it in the garbage.
__label__2 still needs refurbishing  I recieved my refurbished laptop and was surprised on what good shape it was in and was impressed only to have it 2 weeks before problems started, the screen went dark and would not work for about a week, then it mysteriously started working again however battery light continues to flash daily, now i often find the screen now turns white when i turn it on, if i had to do over i would have bought new instead of paying less for something that half the time doesn't work!
__label__3 A nice portable web browser, but reliability problems  I originally posted this as a four-star review, but after the second unanticipated reboot today, I find the Chromebook too unreliable; thus a three-star rating is more appropriate.  This Chromebook is ideal for me. I have a powerful desktop PC, but I wanted something portable to browse the web.  Pros: Boots quickly, wakes quickly from sleep mode Software updates are quick and easy Full featured Chrome browser with Adobe Flash support Small, compact Battery life about 4-5 hours HDMI support lets me play YouTube videos on my 50" plasma TV The worthless function keys are gone and replaced with useful keys including browser forward, back and refresh; brightness, and volume. I do miss the End, Page Up and Page Down keys.  Cons: Printing. The Google Cloud Print service needs improvement. I have to leave my desktop PC running in order to print via the Google Cloud Print server. There is no way to print directly to my LAN connected printer without using my PC as a print server. Printing is the biggest Chrome OS weakness I see.  Difficult to play your own media. Chrome OS is great for media that streams from the web. But it's not very good if you own your own media, whether on a DVD/CD, or purchased through iTunes. Maybe when cloud storage takes off it will be better. The iPad is certainly ahead in this respect.  I have a little trouble with the keyboard. I can't seem to locate the "a" key properly.  The touchpad requires a bit more force to click than I like. [Edit] I like it better know that I have found the "tap to click" setting.  Tabs in the web browser abort with a "She's dead Jim" or "Aww Snap" error message. Reloading the web page usually works. Rebooting the Chromebook seems to work better. The Chromebook occasionally reboots all by itself. At least it reboots quickly.  The Chromebook can't handle most email attachments (ZIP files, Excel spreadsheets). Maybe you could upload some attachments to Google Docs, but that seems really cumbersome.  Cumbersome file manager. I could not figure out how to copy a file from internal flash memory to a USB stick other than opening the PDF file and "Save As...".
__label__3 Well it lasted 40 days and 40 nights  Maybe it's just me.  I think a $1000 machine should be able to make it at least a few months of gentle use without dying on you.  For the general user, this machine has a great combination of features, and it worked well and fast for the month it actually worked; the screen was beautiful.  One day I shut it off and the next time, beep beep beep.  It is now on its way to the service center.  Maybe it will resuscitate, maybe not.  Generally, when a machine eats dust this quickly it doesn't bode well for the long term.  Customer service was very good and efficient -- Toshiba has warranty contracts with UPS Stores to pack & ship them back at their expense, so it was an easy process.  Much better than HP, where I had to pack my own box and wait at home for pickup (slower though).  I'm beginning to think that to buy a laptop you need about $5000 -- enough to go through 4 or 5 of them until you get one that lasts. I had an HP and the Toshiba both turn belly up, and the little generic cheap-o laptop at work just keeps humming along... go figure.  (later adddition ...) Well, the repair held and this machine continues to perform perfectly.  I know it is no longer available, but I'm adding this just to be fair to Toshiba.
__label__4 Was as discribed  The price was fair and the product was as described. It was shipped without a tracking number but arrived .on the date that it was promised. The box was damaged but the computer was wrapped so well that it was fine. It was also wrapped in a static wrap to prevent any problems and worked fine when I plugged it in out of the box. Wish it came with a manual , first apple computer.
__label__4 Outstanding LCD screen, great speakers, compact and stylish but has mediocre keyboard  I bought this laptop (Toshiba Satellite U305-S2804) in January 2008. It has a 1.66 Ghz Core 2 Duo processor (T5450) with 160 Gigs of Hard drive and 2 Gigs of RAM. I got it at a time when Amazon had it on the introductory price (about 200 clams less than the current price and the price lasted for only about 24 hours--yes, it was less than 700 clams). Needless to say (but I'm saying it anyway), I'm happy with the price. As for the product, not too shabby either.  Pros: a) The screen is outstanding. It's hard to convey quality with just the resolution numbers of the screen (1280 x 800) since the numbers are about average. It is something that has to be seen (or take my word for it).  b) The speakers are good for laptop speakers. Of course they won't compare with your Bose speakers but the speakers on this Satellite have plenty of volume and bass (my main complaint for most laptop speakers is that they have very little volume and little bass)  c) 2 Gigs of RAM -- What more needs to be said? Although RAM is cheap these days, it saves you the trouble of buying more ram and installing it. 2 Gigs is enough for Vista. Also, it helps when you have a lot of apps open at the same time.  d) Core 2 Duo T5450 processor -- this is one of Intel's newer processors. It is better (more L2 cache memory) than the Pentium Dual Core T2330 and T2310. So don't pay more for a laptop with the Pentium Dual Core T2330 and T2310.  e) Has a built in webcam  f) Has a dial that you can use to adjust volume (many laptops do not have a dial. You have to adjust volume using software controls).  g) Very responsive laptop. Windows Vista Home Premium rocks!  h) The keyboard layout is spacious (even though the laptop is compact) and the keyboard is very quiet.  Bad:  i) Keyboard flexes under hard typing. There's plenty of keyboard flex especially if you're a "hard" typist (I am). If you apply a lot of pressure when you type, the keyboard will flex. If you're a light typist, I don't think it will be a problem. So far, I've found that the flex does not affect my typing but it is disconcerting. It's hard to fathom how a world class engineering firm like Toshiba can make a keyboard like this!?  ii) You cannot "dock" with this laptop. I think Toshiba gives you a docking connector only with their business class models (the Tecra line). The Satellite line does not have a docking station connector. (The dynadock is not true docking.)  iii) All plastic. This Satellite is made of all plastic. Even where your wrist rests and all around the keyboard area is plastic. I also own a Lenovo laptop (Lenovo 3000 N200) and that laptop has a metal plate where your wrists rest and all around the keyboard area is metal which makes the Lenovo very robust and sturdy.  iv) Wrists area does heat up. I think because the keyboard area is all plastic, heat dissipates slower. My Lenovo laptop feels cooler because the metallic material surrounding the keyboard probably dissipates the heat faster. Though the Satellite U305-s2804 gets warm, it is never so warm that it becomes uncomfortable. It does have pretty good cooling system (copper fins in the cooling area vs aluminium for most laptops).  This laptop is compact, stylish and light. It has an outstanding LCD screen with good speakers (for a laptop), but the keyboard is disappointing.
__label__1 Not as advertised  Item was advertised as being in great condition and as having undergone some kind of inspection.  It showed damage throughout and was not as advertised.
__label__5 Sony Vaio UX  I love the portability of this dandy new gizmo.  I have tried PDA's but I don't like the odd operating systems on them and low storage capacity.  This has a roomy 40GB hard drive and runs Windows XP so it is a powerful machine in an itty package.  I don't have to relearn anything as everything is the same as my desktop model and I can move documents, photos, programs easily from one to the other.  My one and only problem with it has been the quite-small type, especially for older eyes.  But Sony has even compensated for that with a 3 level zoom feature.
__label__1 CTL has WORST customer service ever!  I purchased the CTL 2 go pc and it wouldn't boot to the operating system ( Windows XP ) When I called CTL I was transferred to a guy names John who identified himself as the 2go project manger. When I asked him if he could help me he was rude and aggressive and told me he didn't have the time to answer my questions and transferred me to the technical repair line. I then spoke to a guy who sounded Eastern European and he told me he wasn't in charge of repairing 2go pcs and then he transferred me to a guy named Jason. I got Jasons voicemail and left a message with my name, number and email address. 2 weeks later, no reply. I called again and asked to speak to the manager and was transferred to the voicemail of a guy named Eric Stronqist who is the guy in charge of CTL. Again I left my info, again no reply. Companies like these will be the first to go in this economic downturn and they deserve all they get.
__label__2 Somewhat Disappointed  It had more cracks and dents than the pics showed and the description. I am happy however that the unit appears to operate fine.  Thanks HGH
__label__1 DOA  Bought mine directly from HP.  Dead on Arrival. Wouldn't turn on. Wasted 2 hrs trying everything trying to get it to start, spent half that time with HP tech support. Phone line dropped. I called HP Sales, and they offered a replacement. Fingers crossed. If this next one fails, I'll never buy another HP notebook.  I've had 5 HP printers, all excellent.
__label__3 Nice BIG Laptop  This HP is a beast of a laptop.  I searched to find the newest and fastest machine, and this seems to be it.  I am not a computer geek, but wanted to buy top of the line so that it will last. It was between this and the Apple and the Sony Viao 16.4", and I did go for this for a few reasons.  The Blu-Ray player - the Mac doesnt have one, and also the 1080p screen resolution - Mac's are only 1600x900.  Maybe that doestn matter, but I have a new 55" screen that I wanted to watch blu-rays on and use as a secondary monitor.  I almost got the Sony, but I had an HP for about the past 7 years and it worked great, so I figured to stick with what has worked.  So, after hookup, the machine is running good, however it is a monster, and the neoprene sleeve I purchased for 17.3" Laptops at Office D. DOESN'T FIT.  That means the chassis on this machine is beyond a normal 17.3" machine.  So, I am still looking for a sleeve that this will fit.  It is not a machine you want to take to work with you daily, this is a desktop replacement that you may want to take with you on occasion to a friends or on a long vacation - it is big.  The POWER cable transformer is about the size of a freaking brick, so that also makes the journey even tougher to keep that in the laptop bags as well.  The 2nd battery is awesome, it does last for about 3 hours.  In the past 30 days I have had the machine I used it almost daily, and have had it freeze up about 3-4 times.  That means 1 of 8 times you are using this machine it will freeze, and you have to reboot by holding the power button down til shutdown.  THAT is annoying.  However, it reboots immediately, and very quickly, and back to what you were doing.  Maybe this will be resolved after a few months of configuration/setup changes and more updates, I am not sure what it happening - I am not an expert. I also don't like the arrow keys - they are smaller than my previous laptop.  The Up and Down share the size of one button, and it it tough to find.  I guess I will just have to get used to it.  It is a hot machine too, no doubt.  The fan is much noiser than my 15.6" HP Centrino that I was replacing.  I guess since the CPU is the top of the line, it needs a bit more cooling power.  The wireless network card may freeze up too, as I was watching HBO GO the other day and it froze about 4 times during a 1 hour show.  Maybe it is my new Cisco 3200 router that I recently purchased as well, but not sure.  When this is running good, the download speed is amazing with Comcast xfinity.  I get songs in seconds.  Overall, I like the machine.  It does have it's flaws, but overall I think it is still awesome. It does look good with the etched aluminum finish, backlit keyboard and sound is great for a laptop, and the Photoshop programs you get with it are nice - just did my first Video editing with a soundtrack background - nice.  The 2nd battery is a $125 value, so add that in.  The processor speed is tremendous, and the HD webcam is cool.  UPDATE:  Installed new drivers like the Commentors said, and the computer still froze up every use.  Then it went blue screen on me every hour or so I had it on.  So, I spoke with the HP folks every day after work, running diagnostics and tests for hours at a time. They then overnighted me Restore disks, and I got them and it took several hours over two days to run a complete system restore and software update.  Still didn't help, computer continued to freeze and blue screen on me. During that time, my return policy ran out, so now I can't return it to the seller.  So, now I can only hope that HP fixes the machine, as they finally they sent me a box to send it back to them.  Custormer support is pretty good, they call you daily to check on the problem. But I don't have time to mess around with installing software, I wanted a great laptop that I would have to mess with.  I haven't recieved the repaired machine yet, but they called and said they replaced the motherboard. I went and bought a $300 laptop to use while the 2070NR is in the shop, and it seems to work GREAT (Toshiba L655-S5096).  UPDATE #2: I recieved the laptop after they replaced the motherboard within 5 days, and doesn't seem to have any more problems Freezing up yet.  I guess I got a lemon orginally.  I am bringing my 1 star review up to 3 stars, just because they shouldnt have shipped out all these problems.  Maybe the newer models will be good to go.
__label__3 Price was right but....  This computer looked like new but it had been modified.  When I went to Asus and used their software to identify the computer it showed it to be a different model.  Also some of the drivers were not updated and the touchpad one was missing.  Had to do a number of Windows updates too. Probably spent 4 hours or so getting things right.  Seems to be running very well now.  Not sure what the warranty is either.  It was listed as refurbished but I don't think it was an official refurbishment.  My son has this model and he is very pleased with it.  Time will tell with mine.
__label__2 A flop for email  From its first announcement I looked forward to this machine. It seemed just what I wanted for travel. I bought one as soon as it was available. At the same time I bought a cheap reconditioned Asus Eee netbook ( well used from the sign of the worn touchpad) with XP, merely in order to have access to several hundred MasterCook recipes that aren't usable with Windows 7.   And the Asus runs rings around the Acer. It boots up in half the time, it finds internet sites that are not even hinted at with the Acer, and even boosting the Acer's signal with an Alfa USB adapter, I run into the painfully common and still unaddressed by Microsoft problem of "No internet access." That never happens with the Asus.   A  great disappointment.
__label__4 4 months, so far so good.  I travel back and forth across the Atlantic quite often and simply put, I was tired of lugging around my 4 year old Toshiba laptop (which was quite large, some might call it a desktop replacement).  Not to mention, I had considerable problems with my PC laptop (this one and another) overheating and then just sporadically shutting down.  I'm not much of a techie, but the overheating was, as I perceived it, a real problem and while shopping for laptops, salesmen might have thought I was insane for paying so much attention to the temperature / exhaust fans.  Thus, my main concerns were portability and "coolness."  At the same time, I did not want to compensate performance for portability as I often do Graphic Design and more advanced photo editing. I have been very satisfied with my choice to purchase a Mac as it has seemingly fulfilled all of my very general criteria.  Like so many, I am really drawn to the seamless aesthetic, on and off screen.  Not to mention, the LCD screen is beautiful, the colors are brilliant, and it saves on energy which in the end, saves on battery power and helps with the temperature of the unit.  I love the no hassle video camera feature (which I suppose is no longer a feature, but it is new for me) which provides me a lovely way to keep in touch with my long distance family.  Leopard has a lot of great ideas (some more for "fun" than really essential) and compared to a PC, the Mac is just simply an internal and external clutter free experience.  In laymen terms, in what takes three steps to get somewhere with a PC, you can get there in one step with a Mac.  My only qualms about this computer would be: -1 GB memory (should at least have 2...I am definitely going to add some more (the maximum is fortunately 4)).  If you are looking for additional memory, I would not go to Apple (compatible memory is much cheaper with other companies).  -The screen size can feel somewhat small if you are working with graphics, yet financially it was difficult for me to make the 1,000 dollar jump to the MacBook Pro.  Then again, if portability is a goal, you can't go with much bigger a screen size.  -Though I find the keyboard very comfortable, the trackpad can be at times, oddly uncomfortable.  I would suggest buying a mouse.  The bluetooth feature is excellent (the new world is wireless).  PC users are crazy about the right click....I suppose it is not that integral in my personal experience (I'm a big fan of key commands).  -The sound is not that great.  I think they might have improved the sound quality with the version that came recently after this one (though I am not sure).  Sometimes the pinhole microphone picks up some weird speaker feedback...but this does not happen very often.  If you are an audiophile, invest in a good pair of headphones or simply look elsewhere.  -There are lots of nightmarish reviews about the MacBook power adapter on the Apple website.  Take notice...the adapter (the box with the plug that is) has a habit of getting very hot while charging the battery.  After stumbling across the reviews, I pay attention to the power adapter's so-called behavior.  I notice that the best time to recharge a near empty battery is when the computer is either turned off or asleep.  Avoid running multiple programs while charging a low battery.  Also, the Apple site mentioned plugging in the adapter before attaching it to your Mac (rather than attaching it then plugging it in to an outlet)...for some reason, this seems to help.  In any case, take care of it in order to avoid meltdowns described by other consumers.  On the bright side, I found the magnet at the other end of the power adapter to be very practical (this is another part of my former PC that ended up having problems).  Despite these qualms, I am quite content.  People say Macs and PCs are like two different religions; I think it is good to have experience with both but aesthetically on screen and off, I don't think I can ever go back to PC.
__label__1 Never received the order - no response from seller  Watch out for these guys Ordered computer 6 weeks ago and never recieved it Made several attempts to resolve the issue and they don't respond They never gave a tracking number for UPS. Should be standard MO when shipping a computer. Thank goodnes I used American Express to pay for this.
__label__1 Battery will not charge  Computer worked for a couple weeks. Now it will not charge. How can I return or exchange?
__label__1 horrible!!!  This thing is horrible I'm taking it back!!!!!!! The screen barely stays on the charger seems to have a shortage ,my mom was so disappointed and I'm very unhappy
__label__4 MP Deals is the best!  Buy buy buy from MP Deals! Leo, the rep, couldn't have been more awesome. He was so helpful in helping me choose my computer. He gives his personal cell number out to his customers so he can be reached about any and all concerns. The computer arrived quickly and functions very well. He even shipped me a new adapter quickly because the initial one was frayed. I highly recommend purchasing through MP Deals. It was a fantastic experience.
__label__4 Sony VGN-FW270J  Just wanted to add a couple of things to the previous reviews: 1) I purchased my VAIO just before XMAS with the intent of doing a lot of video editing. So far it has been great (no blue screen!!!). I use Ulead VideoStudio 11+ with a Sony DCVRTR8 and everything works as I expect. This may be because I blew away the factory image on the HDD and reinstalled using the recovery utility. 2) Not the VAIO's fault BUT.....I use MS OneNote 2007 and was greatly disappointed to learn that the "Send to OneNote" feature will not work until the next version of OneNote is released. This is due to the older driver (used by this feature) not working with Vista x64. Strange given that you would expect MS products to work well with one another (that was a joke :-) for the humor impaired).  All in all I have found the laptop to be pretty solid (knock on wood).
__label__1 Terrible Design  Toshiba's A205-S5804 is one of the worst put together laptops I've seen, and as a PC repair technician I've seen quite a few. There are only 2 USB ports on the left side of the machine - which means you need a long USB mouse cord to loop around the back of the machine (for right handed people).  The USB ports are extremely close together and parallel to each other, so any devices you have MUST have an extension cord. Large flash drives, MP3 players, and USB modems will block the 2nd USB port. You must purchase USB extension cords and/or a USB hub. This is extremely frustrating to anyone using Vista's readyboost feature, which allows a flash drive to be used as extra virtual memory.  An Express Card slot allows you to slide a card into the machine, the only problem is that there IS NO Express Card hardware. It is amazingly frustrating to spend 20 minutes trying to line up pins for a device that does not exist.  Preinstalled software includes a gigantic program for controlling Bluetooth (a wireless device like WiFi mostly for printers and phones). This might lead someone to believe that Bluetooth is built into the machine... it isn't. Massive amounts of RAM are devoted to running software controllers for hardware that does not exist.  Also preinstalled are (1) Games you can play only once before having to pay Toshiba to play again (2) Resource hogging anti-virus software that expires in 30 days before demanding hundreds of dollars to keep using it (3) MS Office suite with 30 day expiration  All in all, a badly put together machine. For the same price you can get a refurbished Dell Inspiron with a faster processor, three times the RAM, double the hard drive space, and an integrated 2 mega pixel webcam. HP also makes excellent machines, both refurbished and new. Avoid Toshiba.
__label__3 Nice Laptop, not great, just nice.  Received my DV9750US yesterday. It's got some good features, big bright screen, even when running on battery power. If you know how to set the power settings in Vista. It came with 3GB memory, I wanted 4GB. Stick with the 3GB unless you are running a 64 bit OS. Laptop seems to be plenty fast enough, but I have not installed my Apps yet. Boots up fast and shuts down fast.  Only three stars for the following reasons:  HP's Quickplay does not display in full screen, or at least I have not found the control yet.  Mine came with a Blue-Ray drive, waste of money because it would not play on my  HD LCD TV via the built in HDMI port. Why have a HDMI output and HD DVD player if you can't watch a movie in full screen mode (Blue-Ray only plays with HP's Quickplay software) I would have gotten the model with a HD drive and 2.2 GHZ DC had I known that.  Next is the keyboard, the 'Shift' Key seem too small, or the 'Enter' Key is too big. Takes getting used to.  This model also came with two 250GB hard drives, one for the OS and one for Data. I have not seen any RAID options which would have been nice to have.  I would give the DV9750US 4 or 4 1/2 stars, but the Blue-Ray limitations or QuickPlay limitation just pissed me off. Other than that and no RAID, this may prove to be the best laptop I've had. I'll still buy another one, without the Blue-Ray drive.  Good but not Great.
__label__2 Excellent machine but... did not make the cut!!  This is our first ultrabook and my first laptop from Samsung. As always from Amazon, the package was delivered on time and carefully wrapped.  This is a beautiful piece.  I think it took less than 3 mins from the first time I turned it on and I was firing away.  It wakes up extremely fast also.  I've only had this for 10 days so I don't have an extensive review.  Pros: Very light...as expected from Ultrabook. Fast start-up and wake-up. Speakers are best I've had from a laptop.  Cons: Touchpad is too big, that sometimes my palm gets near the pad and it tries to do something.  I can live with this one. Here's the reason why this unit is going back.... Really bad display..lots of dead pixels!!  I've asked Amazon to replace the unit.  I figured this is an isolated case.  I'll keep you guys posted.  Overall, I'm very pleased.  Well worth the money.  Update: As always, Amazon sent my replacement the next day without questions. This machine is really beautiful.  Unfortunately, I am officially sending this ultrabook back for refund.  I am really sad about this because I really like this machine, but the dead pixels are starting to show up again after only 4 days. It's starting to glitter my screen.  It is more visible under a white background. There are several test sites on the web that you can use to test your machine. I can tolerate other flaws but I can't tolerate a bad screen.  Sorry Samsung!!
__label__4 I love my Mac!  I have used a PC all my life until I went away to college this past year.  I was hesitant at first to get one, but it was one of the best choices I've ever made.  It is very easy to use, is visually pleasing, and is very fast.  The only downside I can think of is the battery life.  I've had my laptop for about a year now and the battery doesn't last for more than 5 minutes.  When I first bought the laptop however, it lasted for around 2 to 3 hours (depending on what I was doing on the computer).
__label__1 ... for a month before it was tournished smh money wasted  Only used for a month before it was tournished smh money wasted
__label__1 Its too slow
__label__2 Barely Audible Sound; Non-existent Support  I would not recommend this product if you need any type of customer assistance. The first problem I encountered was in controlling/disabling the sensitivity of the touch-pad. The support site is useless; the most recent product update is from March 2009. I called their tech support and they were unable to help me. They promised to "escalate" my problem & have someone call me. I never heard from anyone. After approximately 15 hours of frustration & persistence, I stumbled onto a solution by pure dumb luck.  No such luck with the sound. It is tinny & barely audible. I tried fix-its found on the user forums to no avail. Once again, a call to tech support was useless. A promise to escalate my problem and of a return call brought nothing. As I don't like to wear headphones all the time, I finally broke down & spent an additional $45.00 for an external portable speaker. I hope it works.  Toshiba's tech support has no live chat or email. Their forums are not maintained by Toshiba personnel but only by fellow users. They contain hundreds of unaddressed problems. As I stated in the review above, both of my calls to tech support were useless and promises of return calls were not kept.  I would not recommend this product to potential buyers.
__label__1 Overheats - I've had to send it for repair every 3 months  Just wanted to warn everyone out there about Toshiba A505 laptops. I think they were designed poorly and that has lead to an overheating problem when videos are run on it. If you google "overheating toshiba A505" you'll see that I'm not the only one with this problem. I've had to send my in 3 times already and am fed up with toshiba. The do the same thing each time, replace the motherboard and a few components send it back to me and it works for about 3 months until it starts acting up again. I've spoken with one of their "case managers" named James and he said that they won't do anything other than repair it again. So this basically means I spent $1,000 on a computer that is basically only going to last me a year, the length of the warranty. James suggestion was that I should sell it to someone else. What a sad thing to say but seems to be the sentiment Toshiba wants to convey. Instead of admitting a faulty design Toshiba prefers that I stick someone else with their shoddy product. Figures...
__label__1 I want to return it.  Can I?  It is so old I can't find anybody to help me and I can't put my email (outlook) on it!
__label__2 The computer was to old of a model
__label__4 Students, go for it..  If you are a student in school or college and on a budget, then DEFINITELY go for it. I am a PhD student in VirginiaTech and I was planning to get an HP notebook to replace my older HP. My advisor was a loyal Mac user and I decided to follow. I got this Mac and what the hell I was living with Windows. Microsoft mind programmed us to use Windows, Office and wait "stupidly" for the new "worse" Windows. Mac is a really new, wonderful world. Mine was bought last September 2007 so it came with Tiger OS not the latest Leopard. + The OS boots in seconds. Yes, this is not a typo, I mean seconds. +There is "NO" errors, hang ups, system faults, crashes or any other Microsoft crap. +The processor runs smoothly, the RAM is really sufficient, unlike the ever-hungry Windows. + The hard disk has no sound, vibration or any evidence of internal physical movements. + The ComboDrive does not have a tray that pops out with the lens, motors and everything, Instead the media is pulled in smoothly through the slot. + The BATTERY is REALLY INCREDIBLE. Four hours, again yes 4 hours is the least time to run with iTunes running, Safari browsing, iPhoto loading and typing in iWork. In light conditions you can go fr 6 Hours straight. Never happened with Windows. I say windows not a PC because I have noticed that Windows is the guilty one. On your PC you will always see the hard disk running, lighting up and down. Mac OS does not do any of these silly non-logic load.  The cons of MacBook are: -You don't have VGA output and the converter doesn't come with the notebook and you should then buy a miniDVI to VGA converter for $20. - You should only buy hardware like external drives or printers that says "Mac Compatible". - The white casing gets dirty "SO" quickly so make sure that your palms, wrists and fingers are clean.  Conclusion:: Go and get a Mac right now, you are mind programmed by Microsoft.  I took out a star for the White casing and for the built-in shared memory graphics card. If you are a Pro-gamer then you should pay extra money and get MacBook Pro
__label__4 Very Nice Laptop  I purchased this laptop Oct 2007 which was the release date for this product. It is a large laptop and the performance is excellent. The only issue that I have is the battery life. I did not purchase the high capacity battery and my battery life for this standard battery is about an hour. I went back and looked up the price for the higher capacity battery and it's about $300. It was probably a better deal to order it initally.
__label__3 Is it useful?  Some people say it is very bad and others say it is good. Is it good or bad? Can you people out there help me?
__label__2 Great laptop but the one I received was broken.  I love this laptop. The one they sent me originally was broken (the screen wouldnt light up) but I took it to the store and it was replaced. Once fixed, this is the best laptop I have ever used. Good choice for any one.
__label__3 lillians experience  my laptop came with a dead battery. i have to keep it plugged in. When u purchase something you don't waitvtilvyour t to purchase something thurs necessary.
__label__3 works ok  This computer was not equipped with a wireless card like the description stated, but for the price that I paid for it I was ok with that. It was in good condition and all of the parts were there. The battery life on this laptop sucks(about 2 hours tops!)and thats being generous. I will prob buy a new battery soon but I suggest that you don't leave the house without the power cord.
__label__1 Great idea -- poor execution  I really wanted to like this machine.  I've been looking for something like this since I first saw a TRS 80 Model 100 2 decades ago.  Unfortunately, the keyboard is terrible and the trackpad unusable for writing on the go, which was my reason for buying the machine.  I'm returning it.
__label__2 The wear and tear is more than what I expected . Also the screen has two -three white spots and and a black line on the left . I did not had the expectation of having a perfect machine at that price but I felt that the wear and tear along with screen spots are too many
__label__3 Got a refurbished one  I've had this for about three years. The first year - I watched a lot of videos and listened to a lot of music, and it worked like a charm. It was super fast. Enjoyed it so much!  After about a year, it started lagging on webpages. Two years - it heats up over opening more than one or two tabs on Chrome. Forget watching 10+ minute videos. And don't even think about adding a webcam - so much lag. The battery will hardly last an hour when unplugged now. It used to last 3 or 4 hours.  SUMMARY:  -Fast loading/web surfing for about a year -Alright speed after 1.5 years -After 2 years, best use is for word documents and minimal web-surfing. Can handle a video after it's been off a while.  WHO DO I RECOMMEND THIS FOR?  -I recommend this computer to people who have a designated spot for it (it's a bit heavy - I would never carry it around), and would like something to send emails, use word documents, simple programs like MS Paint, and watch a short video every now and then. Anyone who intends to use this computer for more than 2 hours at a time will probably be frustrated with its speed after owning it for 2 years.  OVERALL:  I enjoyed using it for music and videos while it was new. I still like it, but I mostly use it to type up word documents (luckily, I'm a writer. Otherwise, this computer wouldn't have gotten much use after its performance shot down), check my email, and look at a couple webpages. I use the family computer to do pretty much all of my web surfing now. Three stars!
__label__5 Excellent, Easy, Efficient EEE  I wanted this for travel and at work to keep beside my work computer for personal use.  My techno geek husband so wanted me to get a laptop, that when I finally ordered it, that nite as I fell off to sleep I heard him say..."it's not too late, you can cancel that order and get a laptop.." whispered in my ear!!!!  For those of you, (perhaps mostly women, I'm not sure) who have always wondered at the amazing number of programs on your computer that bog it down and don't get used, this has just the right programs.  I highly recommend it :-)
__label__3 A fine disappointment. Mixed reactions.  This is a lovely looking laptop that is everything plus what's on the Acer website describing it. It is well constructed with a long lasting battery. The screen is a thing of beauty: bright, clear, vivid. The built in crystal eye camera is excellent. The N-internet wireless connectivity is fast and consistent.  Unfortunately, the keyboard is mushy. You've really got to get used to it. I'm always trying to find the sweet spot for my fingers when typing since the keyboard seems to be too far to the left. There are, as on most computer keyboards, indentations on the f and j keys to guide your fingers without you having to look down. The real negative is that despite the fast processor, and it is fast (see the Acer website for specs), this laptop is unresponsive at times and you sit there waiting and waiting for something to happen. I'm not sure whether this is because of the processor having to do something or with Vista being busy. It annoying as hell with Vista telling you that the notebook is unresponsive for some unknown reason, but maybe this isn't really the laptop's fault.  I'd give this laptop a B+ overall, but I'd expect better from Acer in the future. For the money it's well worth the cost.
__label__3 Okay, does most of what it should  After a month of frustration with Windows 8, I returned my previous laptop and bought the Acer because it had Windows 7.  It was well priced and already built.  The produt arrived within a week.  So far, the machine works well and does what it is supposed to do.  My only complaint is that the mousepad is nearly inoperable.  It either requires extremely firm pressure or it moves with feather-light touches.  The Mousepad also zooms in and scroll locks unexpectedly as well. I purchased a wireless mouse, but I find having to use the external device frustrating.  Good enough product, life saver if you want Windows 7.
__label__1 Terrible. Bought 4 of these, 3 needed to be replaced after 18 months  I bought these touchscreens to conduct surveys for work. So far, 3 of the 4 have had major problems and have needed to be replaced. All 4 have had significant problems that our IT department was able to fix, but there was significant downtime while the laptops were repaired. Don't buy this laptop.
__label__3 Better than a netbook, but be careful  I bought this computer to replace a netbook I had been using for about a year.  This computer is not intended to be a full powered notebook, so it is best to compare with netbooks.  With that in mind, I have found it to be faster than my prior single-core netbook, I like the slightly bigger screen than a standard and overall find it to be a reasonably good upgrade from the netbook.  Two big cons in my case: 1) the first one I received included a screw rolling around on the inside.  Even though it was there the moment I opened the box, customer support at Acer indicated that if I sent it in for service they may not honor the warranty if they determined it was user abuse.  OK, I understand this, but really, I called the same day I registered the product - play nice.  Instead, I just returned the product and got a new one.  Customer support was not very good or helpful.  The second one I got had a strange intermittent error.  When you type on the keyboard, every so often it would change and make the keys become sequential numbers.  It wouldn't matter what key you hit, it would just type the next number.  So, if you typed "asdf" the computer would enter it as "1234."  I contacted their customer support again, and found out this is a known error with some bloatware they are including on the computers.  After deleting the bloatware (guardid, I think was the name), the system worked again.  The other trade offs in this machine make it a nice balance in terms of price, weight, battery life, size and speed.  If you want something fully functional and fast, go elsewhere and pay more; if you want something that will work for basic functionality, you can carry anywhere and its at a price that you can easily afford, this is a good unit.  I am not impressed with their customer support, but I think that might be normal for all PC makers these days - they don't really like their customers anymore.
__label__1 Lots of early exuberance; maybe time for reality  There's a lot to look at with this laptop.  Large screen, it's pretty, it seems to work fine.  But Vista will break your heart and the graphics on this machine are not sufficient to run flight simulator (and I've got machines that seem downright scumpy and they'll run it).  But it's not just hotel, road-warrior gaming.  Office, all of my six-sigma stuff, just painfully slow.  Oh and Sony won't even begin to talk to you about downgrading to XP.  There have been any number of times where the machine just seems to lock up, a few times where the entire explorer session (files and all) go away.  I'm certain this would be a great XP machine, but have no idea how to do it.  Sigh.  I seriously considered purchasing a Mac, and this machine makes me sorry I didn't follow my instincts.
__label__5 Nice Laptop, for not so much money  We got this laptop for a nice price.  We had a problem with the battery.  We took it to Apple and they said it was the battery.  The seller gave us the money back to buy a new battery, and the laptop has been working great ever since.
__label__1 Did not meet my expectations at all!
__label__3 Ok I guess  Like it but was a little cracked and a piece of it was missing
__label__3 Dirty,webcam not working  Good. Not sure why the webcam not wirking though. Came with quite a few dirt marks and scratches. Good thing I got a cover
__label__4 but works great.  not new, but works great.
__label__3 It's OK, for now.  My wife has been using the EEE PC as a primary computer and has not enjoyed it one bit.  The screen is too small to work and they keys are pretty small hands.  The track pad doesn't appear too responsive but many people complain that my wife is sending her email twice.  I use the computer for travel and doing some work at coffee shop and have mixed reviews.  I like the durability and feel of the machine, although the screen half is top heavy and can roll over backwards if you tilt it too far back.  Taking it travelling was great-super portable and loaded with everything I needed including Skype so I could make free calls from my hotel room through the wireless connection.  The wireless works great, and the the preloaded software is great too.  Some things I don't like about the EEE PC-the battery, maybe we can get an hour out of it...really bad-even with a dimmed screen-I guess to get a true full charge out it we need to turn off the wireless when not in use but that just becomes a hassle to adjust-I have found I leave it at home and take my Palm TX with wireless keyboard out to the coffee shop to do my word processing.  For $300, I don't think you can go wrong.  Also great to have a back-up computer!
__label__3 Vista Experience 2.5......  This laptop was a very large disappointment after the heightened expectations that developed after reading the product description and the reviews...I think the shills might have been busy on this product.  First, it is SLOW. This may be more a Vista problem than a HP problem, but it is slow. The Dell 1505e (1gb mem, 1.6mz Intel Dual Core) that I replaced with this ran XP much faster than this runs Vista. Booting and restarting from sleep takes forever and every screen change is an opportunity to do something else while it loads.  Second, the NVIDIA card is a complete oversell. The gaming graphics card is the "weak link"  responsible for the 2.5 Vista Experience according to the Vista analysis. I bought a few current game titles just to take a look, GRID and Battlefield 2 and they simply overwhelm the machine. GRID, a Vista game, simply won't load, even after all the processes are stripped and the graphics are dialed back. It is like playing under a strobe. Battlefield2 is a few years older and still plays in stop-action. Finally, and most surprisingly, the 3 media players included (maybe more, I stripped out alot of the crapware)barely play without stuttering. PowerDVD, my preferred media player for years, barely functions, and only after, again, all the non-critical processes are stopped. After a little investigation I learned that these titles require a Vista Experience rating of from 4.0 to 5.0. Again this machine has a 2.5 rating based on the NVIDIA card. This was very surprising and very disappointing piece of information.  In sum, if you are looking for a machine to surf and spider solitare on, then this would do just fine, but it seems that you could find another alot cheaper to fill that bill. If you want the high performance that this machine promises, I'd keep shopping.
__label__1 Motherboard/Graphics display problems  This is the second Mac Book Pro I have purchased from AMAZON, this model purchased in early 2012, and another 15" MBP model 3 years earlier. I seem to be having repeat problems as the Mother Board in this one is diagnosed as faulty, related to the graphics card. AGAIN!!! I had this problem with the last one, and after it served me 3 years I thought it was due a change, only to have the repeated problem on this model, after ONLY 18 months from from Date of Purchase. I started getting the Graphic card problem when Opening and Operating iPhoto and graphic intensive programs (Final Cut Pro, Final Cut x etc)...first it was a glitch, like a tv going bad which turned to a blue screen, now it just goes straight grey, and won't restart or run a Disk Utility.  I am saddened by the fact this is the disgusting results I am getting after years of buying APPLE Mac Book Pros. In total this is my 3rd, having bought my first MBP, back in 2003 (whatever they called it then anyway) and that suffered the same problem too.  As I only took the regular 1 year Warranty on this model, and not the extended Apple care, I am asking AMAZON to intervene here, or for APPLE themselves to intervene here. It's plain disgusting to be having repeat problems after continuing to support this brand for almost a decade.
__label__4 Small but delivers!  The&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Asus-Eee-PC-2G-Surf-7-Screen-800-MHz-Intel-Celeron-Processor-512-MB-RAM-2-GB-Hard-Drive-Linux-Preloaded-Galaxy-Black/dp/B00114T9WY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Asus Eee PC 2G Surf (7" Screen, 800 MHz Intel Celeron Processor, 512 MB RAM, 2 GB Hard Drive, Linux Preloaded) Galaxy Black</a>&nbsp;packs enough features in a very small footprint. The screen seems tiny but is readable, and its processor (Celeron) has enough power to run the included applications. The Linux version (Xandros) has a very friendly user interface, easy enough to be used by almost anybody. The only disappointment is the battery life, it should last longer given that the laptop does not have any moving parts (Like a CD-ROM or a hard drive). Also, the laptop tend to heat because of the processor.
__label__1 Great Product BUT Delivery A Problem  Just a note to others - Amazon says it is "in stock" but they still haven't shipped the computer I ordered on Sept. 12 for overnight delivery and all I get are apologies or excuses. So if you need this right away.....be warned that "in stock" really means very little.
__label__5 Definetly MBP  As a former pc enthusiast I loved every bit of my new macbook pro. I enjoy its portability, speed, stand and rock solid stabilty. Good bye blue screens ...
__label__3 Great Revision/Sandy Bridge  This machine is the best laptop I've ever owned and my first Asus.  Not as much bloatware as others have claimed. Plan to upgrade as the Ram-comes with only 4 GB.  That's kinda funny.  I'm so old that I can remember when I upgraded Ram from 64MB's to 128MB's for about $200.00. Times have changed. For around $80 I ordered Corsair 2X4 GB. from Amazon, it was a Really Great Upgrade.  Remove the two bottom rubber pads for easy Ram install, screws are underneath.  Hiding the screws has driven consumers nuts for months and has been widely discussed in forums, but not by Asus.  No where in the manual does it mention the base pads as covering the screws.  The new revision of the Sandy Bridge chipset took away the Sata plug-in, I heard it was an engineering oversight that was causing 15% of the released machines to fail (melt).  Once discovered, they were recalled. The cost was initially estimated to be in the millions. AMD's chip manufacturing sent Intel a Valentine's Day card last February as a sarcastic slap on the wrist for their bragging up the new Sandy Bridge- i7 chip.   Intel replaced it(Sata) with the new USB 3 port. Sandy Bridge also has 4 slots for a total of 16 GB's of ram (4X4GB). Intel is still the best out there for multi-tasking, with gaming being AMD's forte.  The only problem I had was with the system restore turning off after I re-partitioned the hard drive with Easus third party utility.  Had to hit F-9 on reboot to correct this and install operating system in first partition again (your given a choice of first partition, make one partition C drive or two partitions C=25% D=75%).  Do not get rid of the Games, as this will disable the volume hot keys. These are easily fixed as the ATK utilities are included with the accompaning disk or on the Asus websight.  All given, I am very pleased with this machine. Keyboard has some flex, but is easily adjusted to. I just removed the Microtrend antivirus and installed the new Norton 360 which I think is one of the best out there.  It's new protection is faster than their older versions as it has a function to adjust the safe programs from the questionable ones thereby speeding up the scan alot. The other bloatware is up to you.  For $1000, the full HD screen is well worth it although it has a narrow viewing angle. Again you'll adjust to it. The many hot-keys take some getting used to but are well worth the extra time to learn.  Beautifully designed and loaded with muscle and features, this machine excels.  UPDATE FEB 2012- Just a side note to tell you that this keyboard is useless. It started to malfunction almost immediately. I finally got around to getting an original ASUS chicklet style replacement. It was around $50.00 with shipping- Here is the keyboard model number 04GNV32KUS00-1 This is a great improvement over the original keyboard. See Asus keyboard replacement video on YOU TUBE.
__label__5 Cool light weighted laptop  I found this laptop working pretty amazingly. the high speed and light weight are just perfect for taking it to school everyday and for traveling. however i found out that some times the speakers made some weird noise and the DVD player made lots of noises as well. I wonder if it really is like that or there's something wrong with my laptop. However the new vista working pretty nicely and easily used and just like the other review, i found a lot of unneeded programs from toshiba which i ended up deleting it and blocked quite a lot of start up programs coz it's really annoying. It also has pretty sensitive hard drive that suddenly activate the so called HD protection everytime the laptop is moved. But other than that it's really a nice laptop and i'm really satisfied with it.
__label__1 Good operating system but be prepared to be nickel and dimed by Mac for things like the substandard power cable that will run you $28 a pop a couple times a year. More garbage for the landfill.
__label__5 Best of all worlds  I love this computer, I did upgrade memory from 1GB to 2GB of RAM. (bought 2gb on ebay for $75) This is required due to there is no Video RAM built in the macbook. I run this with the V3.0 parallels, like have mac and window running seamless together. Over all the system runs super fast as does the wireless network and bluetooth. Recommend highly.
__label__4 Great laptop, can't say much for the OS  The only bad thing about this laptop is the fact that Microsoft has once again shoved an inferior OS down our throat by the name of Vista.  Too bad HP is not allowed to upgrade this from Vista to XP or Win2000 would be even better!
__label__5 Perfect PC  Best price, right size, only need to get more memory,(on it's way 2gb's), 7 pounds wt, nice screen res, will recomended to anyboddy., good batt life
__label__5 Dell D600 Laptop  This product exceeded my expectations. For a used laptop, I have not had a single problem with it. I am very happy with my purchase.
__label__2 BOO!!  This laptop is slow.. It is garbage. I am going to throw it away. Waste of money. I should have asked for a refund.
__label__2 Hopefully I got the bad apple!!  I have owned a HP, Toshiba, Dell, and a Gateway PC and never had as many problems as I did with this laptop. All straight out of the box. I have used this laptop all of maybe six times and it has shut down on me in mid operation at least 3 of those times. I have received multiple error messages saying "windows is attempting to repair" etc... It has been non-operational from the very beginning, not to mention it required 8335 updates. Even after the updates it ran poorly. This entire situation has been very frustrating. I am not surprised as to why they have such a "no questions asked" type warranty, clearly one is needed. I would not recommend this PC to anyone.
__label__5 Second Lap Top Was A Success  I really didn't know that operating a laptop would be so fun & easy.  Not to mention convenient; I can take it with me because it also runs off of a battery.  Its powerful; fast and really professional looking.  Great buy.  Mark
__label__3 not sure!  well overall i like it but i have had problems with the touch pad and haven't found the correction yet but other than that it seems to be working ok
__label__3 Great Netbook but...  This is actually a great netbook but with one fatal flaw; it has the "worst mouse pad ever!". Even after tweaking the settings it just does not cut it.
__label__5 Excellent purchase  Using my Asus Eee PC is great.  I like it for surfing the Internet and the pop up blocker is really worth it.  I like the fact that only a website I allow can open a new window on my computer.  Great!  Also, The office programs are really nifty.  I use the spreadsheet and word editor frequently.  This laptop is easy to use in limited space making it easy to put away when not in use.  It's very fast and in my case I use the built in wi-fi to connect my high speed connection really easily.  The two USB ports are nice because later on I can upgrade to CD-RW for burning mp3's while the Monitor output will increase the viewable size connecting to my LCD TV.  The Frozen bubble game is really fun.  Finally, I appreciate this pc as being very affordable.
__label__1 Defective  The laptop worked for a couple of hours then shut down and would not restart. Took it to an expert and was told that I new motherboard. Which basically  means a new laptop
__label__2 I wouldn't buy again, but not a complete waste.  I've had this computer for 4 months now. I was told that the computer was purchased for around $600. I see on here it's going for as much as $850! THIS COMPUTER IS NOT WORTH THAT MUCH MONEY. $500 maybe. I have a couple of minor peeves about this computer. First, you cannot burn CD's with iTunes. I have been trying since i got it to burn CD's and eventually I just gave up and figured i must have been wrong in thinking in could burn CD's. Well come to find out that Toshiba just isn't fixing the problem and selling the computer for way more than it's worth. Secondly, you cannot play the Sims 2 on it. I was devastated when i found this out. All that money on expansion packs down the drain because once again Toshiba is overpricing this laptop and putting in crappy hardware. Thirdly, it runs somewhat slow. If I've got photoshop open AND I want to open a game AND go on the internet... well.. you could be there for a while. Also, THE BATTERY LIFE SUCKS BIG TIME. Heaven forbid you have a two hour class with no plug nearby! I can tell you right now that with ALL the settings turned down to their lowest and the battery life fully charged that this computer gets EXACTLY 2 hours and 10 minutes. Lastly, it's pretty ugly. It has ZERO ZERO ZERO cool or visually pleasing aspects about it's appearance. Don't even get me started on the black cover with a WHITE KEYBOARD.  My mom just bought an HP for $750 and it is 20 times more decked out than this computer, AND CHEAPER than it is selling for on here. Even so, mine was $600 and it would be worth it to you to drop the extra $150 for something that will have everything that a basic needs computer should have.  This is an overpriced piece of ugly junk that can't burn cd's in itunes, play the sims 2 or multi task and will probably die when you need it the most.  I only gave it two stars because it's never blue screened or blacked out on me like I've heard that it's done to other people.
__label__1 DEFECTIVE LOGIC BOARD  Got it from AMAZON WAREHOUSE DEALS and the logic board is messed up and I have it repairing at my local apple shop. Very disappointed that this is supposed to be tested and functional like what is says on the unit but obviously it really was not. So buyers be aware you may get a defective unit and if you want to save a few bucks but maybe have to go thru the hassle of fixing it because it is still under warranty go right ahead but like me if you really didn't have time for repairing it don't risk it.
__label__4 Great Little PC  I love my Eee PC. Most people had never even heard of this PC. I did a lot of research on it and bought it. Amazon had the best price. I use it every day. Really enjoy it. It is not for every one, but it does everything I need it to do. Easy to use, set up easy and it is really a cute PC. Yes, that is important to me too. I have several friends that have bought one since they have seen mine and they are all happy. It fits in my purse and the battery life is good. The key board is smaller and it takes a little time to get use to it, but I did with no problems now. For the price, you get a lot of PC. I plan to buy one for my daughter for Christmas this year. Over all, I love it.
__label__3 Great Graphics, horrible keyboard  I really wanted to love this computer, since the graphics were so sharp and vivid, the battery lasts FOREVER, and it's very nice to look at. But, alas, I simply could not get past the horrible keyboard. 80% of the time a hit on the spacebar would produce no space, I'd find myself wacking the thing to get it to respond. It just became to frustrating to deal with. And trust me, I tried to get used to it, kept it for a week, really trying to see if I could adjust my typing style to accomidate it. To a degree I did, but I also noticed every time I'd hit the space bar it clicked loudly, much more than any of the other keys which was very annoying when you're in a quite place. I really wanted to find a way to like it, and keep it. Sadly, Acer customer care, didn't really care much if I kept it either, their advice was just send it back since I was within the return policy.
__label__3 Heavy, but bright and sturdy  Definitely consider for home desktop replacement.  Sturdy - but heavy - huge bright screen.  Good buy
__label__3 Reviwew of Lattitude E5400  The computer was in pretty rough condition when recieved. Cracks in the case but so far it is working well.  Battery does not seem to hold a charge but keeping it pluged in is working for me at this time.
__label__1 I was so disappointed  It only worked for 3 weeks and never came back on... I was so disappointed
__label__2 low GB's???  I'm looking at the specs and I think I need to point out that the memory is only 4GB... (LOW) in today's standards.  Also the Hard Drive is only 16GB(very LOW), the computer i'm working from has 6GB memory(upgraded from 4GB) and 500GB HD, purchased 2 years ago...  I love Google and Samsung, I was excited about a laptop for just $249-$449, but the Chromebook 550 just doesnt have the hardware for me to replace my (6GB Ram and 500GB HD) Lenovo Lap Top with.  New products are usually not so good, I hope they get all the bugs out and put out a comparable Lap Top soon... Look at the specs guys and compare what you are purchasing before you make a $249-$449 mistake.
__label__5 Great product  I  purchased the black Macbook with 1 GB RAM in June. So far, so good! The battery does get hot but not exceedingly. Battery life is not outstanding, but workable. Recharging is easy: I usually recharge my ipod the same time I am recharging my notebook battery.  I have not explored all the programs available as yet. At the moment, I just download my photographs and short movies to the hard drive. Surfing is effortless. It is an enjoyable little machine to own, and it looks good too.
__label__1 Computer was not capable of being internet and media ready  We bought this for our daughter who's going to college this summer. It was to have all the bells and whistles so nothing was needed... She opened on christmas morning and couldn't connet to the internet, couldn't listen to music and couldn't watch a dvd. We will now have to pay just as much to get it up to speed as it was to buy the computer in the first place. Very sad considering it took all we had to get this for her!  One income house hold and 6 kds to buy for, getting a laptop at a discount was a dream and as dreams do, they disappear.
__label__5 good hardware and software                Bluetooth
__label__4 Really great notebook for the price!  I've had this notebook for about a month and I'm happy so far. As has already been stated, the 1GB of memory is not enough. But memory is cheap. I  upgraded to 2GB, and it performs very well. If you don't mind only having 2 USB ports (hubs are also cheap), this is a great machine.
__label__3 Good Laptop but im having problem sometime with the touchpad  I receive my laptop last Oct 21, 2010 because I work on the ship.  Im very impressed with the look of the laptop.  It doesn't look cheap and the design was elegant.  The only problem that I encountered is sometimes when I press the touchpad button (the one on the left), its not responding... Sometimes i need to tap the center touchpad before it response... it is hassle when i want to drag a file...i cant drag it because the left button is not responding... and I used this laptop for Deejaying so dragging files is common in my command... Sometimes I need to try it several times before it rsponse... I am not sure if i need to upgrade the driver for touchpad or not but its giving me hard time... I haven't complaint yet to Amazon because I'm still testing it.  The rest of the specification is good and fast.  I will recommend this laptop...  Please put comment if you have the same problem like mine... So that I won't waste my time testing it...
__label__2 I need a option for latinamerica Warrantly  i like know If Amazon have a option for Latinamerica Warrantly, My HP is in Colombia and this have a damage in your memory. The warranty is Only in USA, and mi HP not have warrantly in mi country. Wath option I have in this case?
__label__5 First MacBook, won't be my last  This was the first MacBook I have ever purchased. I wasn't sure about how it would be to transition from using only a pc my whole life to trying out this alternative. Boy am I glad I switched. The MacBook functions perfectly and quickly. I performed a very unofficial comparison of my new MacBook to my almost identically matched HP PC and the results blew me away, I started them up at the same tIme and was browsing the internet and playing the Sims 3 on my MacBook before the pc even logged in to windows. Overall a great purchase and I will purchase more in the future.
__label__5 lapster  I was very pleased with amazon's ordering, service and delivery. The laptop seems to be everything I expected. I really like the fact that you can use 2 finger scrolling on the touchpad, makes it easy to get around. Buy one before December and you get FREE Leopard System 10.5 from the Apple website, just pay handling and tax (10.87). I'm still debating whether to get applecare. For the price of the computer I'm thinking I will. Had bad luck with my iMac 17" that was just 1.5 years old. Screen lines and motherboard. Hope this review helps.
__label__2 It worked..  Worked for class like I needed it to, didn't let me download apps though. Also, I turned it off once I was finished with it and it has yet to turn back on, it's been almost a week and I have an online class that I'm falling behind in.. When I plug the charger in, the light is green but no matter how long or how many times I press the power button, the screen is still dark. Not okay..
__label__3 does it have hdmi port?
__label__1 DO NOT BUY FROM CAJUNMAN He is an irresponsible and disreputable seller..  The product I received was very very poor. I am not talking about cosmetically, because age and use happens in 7 years of course. But to have the charger spark and short out immediately, and the screen not even stay up, and the optical drive won't even take a disk let alone function with one. His response to me was that I had too high expectations for a 7 year old computer. But at the price and description as Used acceptable one would expect it would work some how?!?!
__label__3 Monitor problems beware.  I love the 13.3" Macbook Air, I love not having a hard drive, I love how light it is and even with only 4gigs of RAM with the SSD drive I find it plenty fast.  Unfortunately the display has a brownish/yellowish tint to it.  I had Amazon send me a replacement but it's display was even worse.  A lot of research on the web found that this is a common problem, inconsistent displays.  They use a few different manufacturers for it and all I can say is the one that made mine isn't very good.  Perhaps their Patent lawsuit against Samsung has made them stop buying monitors from them, which are supposedly the best.  I am bringing this in to the Apple Store to be sent out to be repaired, but the first time I went in they said it was within spec this way, that maybe it would be replaced if I sent it back.  I'm going to insist.
__label__5 Pleasure  I thinked a lot before purchasing a Laptop, it took me 2 months reviews and finally I decided for this one. Everything in this Laptop is perfect, yes it heats little more than my previous but it is fast and it doesnt create any problems on whatever you do in it, like playing, my brother does that a lot but doesnt effect on it. i loaded the hard drive to maximum and it still performed fast. I waited two months to create a review and i tried everything in him. it came up that its tuff to,:)  The only minor problem it have is: In the begining when you install updates the cam will not work properly, but you cam fix it in 2 min at device manager.  Have fun, :)
__label__4 Solid Machine  This is a pretty good machine. The form factor is great in terms of both design and size and its plenty fast for most applications. The built in software such as iMovie and iPhoto are very easy to use and surprisingly powerful. The operating system is also more stable than what i'm used to with windows. You set it and forget and everything pretty much works. No more of the niggling issues I always have on my windows machine.  Installing windows is also very easy though I never use that.  What I don't like is the case. The build quality on the inner casing material is quite poor. I've already had the edges on the bottom right by the trackpad crack twice. Apple has fixed it but its still a pain. My sister has the same issue which leads me to believe that the build quality on these isn't what it should be. The white also discolors on the palm rests very easily and is tough to clean.  Still i'd buy it again in a heartbeat and am very satisfied overall.
__label__1 The worst that I purchase ever.  I put 1 start because the 0 start option is not available. I don't know how HP continues selling this garbage. I bought one (HP Pavilion Tx1410us) and less than 1 year the motherboard failed.
__label__3 Item not as described....  Over all, the iBook is all right, and it works really well  However, when something is advertised as "like new" the buyer expects that to be true within reason.  I expected that since it was used, even though it was described as "like new" there may be a few barely noticeable scuffs, etc.  However, this iBook had MANY scuffs and scratches, it is badly scratched and scuffed.  To be honest, I would not have purchased it if it were described  in any way OTHER than "like new."  So I feel their description of the iBook was misleading.  I don't plan to return it.....there are covers etc. I can buy that will hide the scuffs etc.
__label__4 Apple MacBook Pro  Lack of written material makes it difficult for users who are accustomed to Windows to start off.  The Boot Camp Assistant that is supposed to be able to install and run Windows has obvious flaws that users - and some Apple resellers - haven't so far been able to solve. The notebook itself is well designed and well made, with excellent graphics.
__label__2 Rrefurbished item such a disappointment  I purchased this product as a gift for my daughter and she only had it for some months and it totally went out.  It doesn't cut on when you try to turn the power on.  I was truly disappointed.  I will not buy any more refurbished items again.  Truly disgusted.....
__label__3 its good for the price
__label__1 Not a good product. Seller was helpful with all the problems I experienced but had nothing but trouble with product the one year we have had it.
__label__2 Don't buy if you want to actually use it long term  The computers audio has stopped working after only 2 months of normal use, on top of that half the time it dosnt charge and it crashes randomly with no warning... this person is selling old computer that he probably refurbished to look nice but at the end of the day don't work nice... buy from this seller and all yull be getting is a laptop that will function correctly for 2-3 months and then start breaking, totally wish i could return it because this is garbage
__label__3 OK  Product was very good but I was not comfortable with the Linux operating system. I could not get the email to work with my provider. my problem. I returned and received credit.
__label__5 Good value for money  (...)  For the price offered, it's hard to beat. The XP-M processor is the counterpart to the Pentium-M and saves battery power. Plus, with 802.11g and an 80GB drive, it fulfills all my needs as amedia desktop as well. Great functions for a low price. [...]  Two thumbs up for Averatec.
__label__3 Fame PC Fixed the Problem  The first 2 laptops I received were defective.  Fame PC sent a 3rd laptop that is working well now. Hurray
__label__5 Very cool  First Mac.  Very cool.  Easy to use.  Did I mention it is very cool?
__label__2 Laptop did work but the screen  light  would not stay  bright.
__label__4 VGN-NR220E/S: A cool machine, a super value  Shoppers should note that this page is home to a variety of Sony notebooks, accessed by the pull-down menu at the top of the page. The description and prices change as you select a model, but the reviews do not.  I researched extensively for user reviews on this model and other low-end Sony VAIO laptops. Results showed above average satisfaction. So I bought one!  I have had the VGN-NR220E/S model for only a short time.  I am initially impressed by this notebook. After you uninstall/delete all the bloatware Sony loaded this thing with, the 1GB of memory handles Vista without much problem. Yet, benefits are assured with a RAM upgrade, and I plan on one soon.  The screen is pleasantly large and refreshingly crisp with vivid colors, Sony really knows how to produce a superior display.  Although all plastic, the build quality is solid for a low-end PC which can be had for less than 600 dollars.  Cons: Vista - oh well, I never thought I'd miss using XP. No bluetooth, built in camera or built in mic. There is no line level audio input, and it utilizes the older/smaller Express Card 34 slot. None of these were deal breakers for me. Note also that Sony does not include ANY install disks. You can order them for about 18, or apparently you can burn your own.  Other than that, lots of inputs, including firewire and wireless networking are included here. Also the the optical drive will write dual layer DVD's.  This Sony won't have me giving up my G5 tower or either of our sleek Powerbooks, but it will be very effective when one must use a PC, and it didn't cost thousands.  If you are not a gamer or a power user, and you want a laptop with a fair sized, brilliant screen, then you could do a lot worse than this VAIO.  Just be prepared for the shock-of-Vista.
__label__3 runs a bit hot
__label__2 Not good  I bought this laptop a week ago and the backlit keyboard would not work. I talked to the Samsung support service and after a few attempts to fix it, they told me to return it. Quite fast laptop though, great sound and screen resolution. However there is also a problem with the wireless, which s turned off every time I shut down the laptop. Very annoying. I would not recommend it.
__label__3 Both and hardware and software needs more work  Was not satisfied with the hardware as well as software: -Some of the keys did not work perfectly (h,m). Double types it even if I press it only once. -The Trackpad seemed risen from the bottom portion. -Chrome OS still feels a bit premature. Needs more work.
__label__2 Uuuuh, Some bad luck  Its a very nice and potentmachine, bu dadly for me, the one i purchased presente a failure after only 15 minutes using it. Display went  black and never turned on again... This is why i placed a refound request. Hope the next one, work propperly
__label__3 Battery is crappy
__label__2 Display problmes and no software  This was my first Sony laptop purchase after buying from Toshiba and Dell in the past.  My first impression was very positive but shortly after I noticed flickering in the display.  After a couple of days the display got worse, with the flickering increasing in frequency.  I then spent the better part of a day trying to work out the problems with Sony tech support.  After trying everything they suggested I now have to send it for repairs.  This is also the first time I've purchased a computer and didn't receive software re-install CD/DVD's.
__label__4 Good one  I paid just the fare price for a used computer... the computer is working well so far.
__label__2 Great Laptop...Lousy Speakers and Webcam  I love everything about the laptop but for the poor quality speakers. If you anticipate watching DVDs on this laptop or listening to music, this laptop is not for you. If you anticipate using the webcam for video recording this laptop is also not for you as there is not provision for white balance adjustment and low light compensation is poorly executed. If you are looking for a laptop with long battery life, this laptop is not for you. If you are looking for a laptop with enough online technical support from manufacturers, this laptop is not for you.  If you are looking for a laptop with great keypads and a keyoard lay out similar to that you get with the regular desktop, then this laptop is for you. If you are looking for a laptop that runs pretty fast and is setup for maximum protection of your data, this laptop is for you.  Besides the horrible audio and webcam quality...I think this is fairly priced for all the features that come boxed into it.
__label__1 Crashes if volume control used after waking up from standby  I bought a Gateway 200E (200 ARC series) 2 days ago from another online store (I'm still posting it here, so that other potential buyers may find out about this before making a buying decision). The quality, features and speed are good. The reason I'm giving 1 star is because Gateway doesnt accept responsibility for their bugs, and doesn't want to fix them. If I put the computer into standby and then wake it up, and use the volume control by pressing Fn + left or right arrow keys, the system crashes. It freezes completely. Even ctrl + alt + del doesn't work. I called Gateway, and this is what they said: "It's an already documented problem with this model. Gateway doesn't have a solution for this problem, they only have two workarounds: 1. Don't use the Fn + key combo for volume control, use the volume control icon on the system tray with your mouse. 2. Don't use the Fn + key combo for a while after waking up from stand by" My reply to #1, I don't want to look for the icon and click it, I want a shortcut whenever I want to control the volume. That's what it is there for. Besides, I press ctrl + arrow to tab through my text documents. It's very easy to press Fn instead of ctrl, and this is more possible in this model especially since Fn is the outermost key on the left side, and ctrl is to the right side of it, unlike most other laptop keyboards where ctrl is the outermost key. I don't want my laptop to crash when I'm browsing through my text documents or writing code. #2. I even tried doing this after an hour, and it still crashes. I have the latest BIOS (v 42.01.02), and Gateway doesnt have a newer BIOS update of fix for this. I use Win XP Pro, by the way. This crash is reproducible every single time I do what I described above (use volume control after waking up from standby). Gateway said they just won't fix it or replace this laptop. If I send it for service, they won't give me a time estimate of how long it will take to fix it. They are just trying to deter me from sending it for service I guess. The tech who answered my second call was so rude and yelling on the phone telling me not to use the key combo, rather than focusing on how to fix it. He even said he won't let me talk to Level 2 tech people when I asked. I had to give him a piece of my mind before he would let me talk to Level 2. The level 2 guy was even more ridiculous. He suggested that I use the screensaver instead of standby. Moron, he doesnt even know the difference between the use of a screensaver and a standby mode. Perhaps, he thinks people who buy their laptops are starfishes who they can push around and deny service for their defective product. How many of you have had this problem replicable with the Gateway 200 ARC series? Can you try this on your laptop and see if it happens? Does anyone know a fix for it? I badly need it. If you have the same problem, or know how to fix it, please email me at sen@stanmed.net If there are enough number of people with this problem, without proper service being provided by Gateway, I think a class action lawsuit would be feasible. Thanks. Sen.
__label__5 Great computer  The VAIO NR220E/S is not a bad computer at all for a budget laptop.  It has excellent features.  There is a lot of bloatware. But what computer doesn't come with that? Windows has a neat little feature called "Add/Remove Programs."  It is a must to upgrade to 2 Gb of Ram, though.  Vista is a memory hog but in return, you get a neat OS.  The sidebar is a handy feature and it's great that Vista has so many security features built in.  I've noticed people writing about some of the networking/LAN issues and the issue, in my experience, seems to be SONY's network managing software.  Once you know what's going on, it's easy enough to deal with any issues.  Of course, the Smart Network software can be uninstalled itself, and that would likely remedy anything for good.  It sure isn't a big enough concern for me to give this computer anything other than a stellar rating for a basic, budget laptop.  It's sleek and feels much more high-end than it is.
__label__4 Good Value for  the Business Traveler.  This review is for a HP Pavilion dv7-1132nr, which is similar and has the same processor and video card.  The Positives: The 17 inch bright screen is nothing short of spectacular.  It does not have an anti-reflective coating, which is good if you need to see a lot of small text or fine detail, but bad if you are in a reflective environment. If you do large spreadsheets, MSProject etc. this is a good choice; however the contrast ratio (black level) for multimedia use is not that good.  The speakers and sound are above average for laptops although lacking in the bass range. This is nice because it comes with the Media Center version of Vista.  This laptop is huge, yet very light, with a full numeric key pad and room for a second hard drive on the inside.  A large Touch-pad that is easy to use. Convenient additional controls and indicators are located around the keyboard.  A convenient concealed SDHC slot just begs for a Vista ReadyBoost dedicated card to be installed (a 4GB max SD card will greatly improve the operation of Vista).  The included 64 bit Vista operating system will access future upgrades of up to 8GB of ram.  The integrated Wi-Fi was able to access neighboring networks. This laptop also includes the following connections: * 1 56K Telephone Modem (RJ-11) * 1 Integrated 10/100 Ethernet LAN (RJ -45) * 3 USB 2.0 * 1 VGA (15-pin) * 1 HDMI * 1 combo eSATA or USB 2.0 * 2 headphone-out * 1 microphone-in * 1 ExpressCard 54/34 slot * 1 Infra-Red window * 1 notebook expansion port-3 (HP Proprietary) * 1 remote control  Now for the negatives: The construction of the large screen is not very rigid, and the hinges are tight, to the point that one must use two hands to open the lid, lest it flexes to the point of breakage.  The battery life is short so I don't even bother to install the battery (why carry the extra weight) and exclusively use the power cord.  Speaking of the power cord, it exits on the right side, so it may cause some interference with right handed mouse use.  The video card and processor are on the low end and not up to gaming standards, although it is more than adequate for multimedia and business applications. HD video playback is adequate if you use appropriate player software other than the included Microsoft's Media Player.  Except for the Vista Operating System, most of the included software is trial-ware. Some older drivers and utility software will not work with the 64bit Vista.  Conclusion: In short, this is a good value for a desktop PC replacement for the business traveler.
__label__4 Sony Vaio NR220E/S - WAY TO GO!  This is for the Sony VAIO NR220E/S (bought at BestBuy for US$ 599,99).  PROS: 0- Price.  :) 1- LCD (this XBRITE-ECO stuff looks really nice). 2- Speakers (ARE AWESOME!). 3- Brand (c'mon.. it's a VAIO). 4- Firewire. 5- Card Reader (Memory Stick Pro Duo and another one with SD).  CONS/MISS: 1- Missing Native Bluetooth Connectivity (it's a mess to have to use cables to my Phones and Headsets). How COME?!?!?! 2- Windows XP OEM (Vista sucks). I'm not sure if the problem is the the Processor, the amount of Memory (and its speed) or the Hard Disk Drive speed... but this notebook was the slowest thing in a long time (been working since IBM PC XT). My gess is that VISTA is killing this laptop. Please, upgrade the memory or install Windows XP immediately after purchasing it. 3- Missing Camera (an integrated webcam would be really nice and wouldn't even cost US$20). It would add a lot of extra power and appeal to the NR220E/S 4- Missing regular PCMCIA/PC CARD (instead of the XPRESS CARD 34 Sony's put). It would be nice to keep my old Bluetooth, 3G/GSM and GPS PCMCIA Cards. 5- 1 card of 1GB RAM (instead of the cheap 2x512MB Sony's put). This is not a major problem since the BIOS allows up to 4GB (don't trust the Sony Ad). 6- Silver Keyboard. It would be just perfect... even if Sony decided to keep the bottom of the laptop in the same color (BLACK). 7- Multimedia Keyboard keys (funcion keys would do the trick). 8- Battery Life.  Conclusion:  I'd buy this laptop again, and I'd upgrade immediatelly to XP and to 4GB RAM. The next step would be to get a new (extended) battery and a faster HDD.
__label__2 poor keyboard, mouse buttons - look out  Not bad for Web browsing, light games and light email, but not up to use for business.  The keyboard and mouse buttons are very poor - overly sensitive, making it impossible to type or navigate without errors.  If you're looking for a laptop for any type of business use, look elsewhere.  PC was returned to Amazon.
__label__2 Not for the Ubuntu bound  Pros: +Good price +Lightweight +2GB DDR3 RAM +250GB Disk +11.6 inch screen  Cons: -Ubuntu has compatibility issues with the hardware. I tried Desktop 10.10. The system suspends but takes 5 minutes (exactly) to come back, and wifi has to be manually enabled after that. Further, it hangs when I try to hibernate. It seems to be a common unresolved issue. Also, Ubuntu does not recognize the touchpad and instead uses it as a PS2 mouse. This means that not only are multi-touch gestures not supported, even vertical scrolling does not work (which is flaky on Windows also). -Keyboard is too big. Home and End keys are overloaded on Page up and Page down (I use Home and End a lot so always pressing Fn to do this is annoying) -Touch pad is too small, and not very responsive at times -Battery life not great (I get between 5 and 5.5 hrs)
__label__5 Solid, lighter & faster than my desktop!!  I own it only for a week now. Yet to explore several features. First impression is very good. Build quality is very good. No drag, faster, lighter. Wireless connection is good. Screen quality is good. Best thing is the video chat. Built-in camera mic are way better than my Logitech Quickcam Fusion(which is supposed to be one of the best). Played DVD quite nicely while downloading, doing other stuff. S-video works well.  Did not test DVD writer. Did not try playing media without booting  OS yet. Did not stress test the system yet.  The Good: 1) Screen quality (compared to many other laptops). 2) Build quality, looks - SOLID 3) Comes with Wireless - N. 4) Intel's Newer Graphics chipset, better for Vista Aero. 5) My old sony used to have fan noise. This one is pretty good there. 6) Considering it is Sony, the price is pretty good. Got it for 1149 at Circuit City.  The Bad: 1) It is still pricey. 2) Does not have graphics card, for gamers. 3) Does not have HDMI. 4) Battery life is poor about 1.5-2 hours with power save mode on!! 5) I think the resolution for 15.4 inch should be better. It supports only 1280x800 otherwise what is the use of bigger screen, it will only reduce battery life. 6) Does not come with remote for media play. Play, pause, volume control buttons cannot be accessed with display closed. 7) Speaker quality is below average. 8) No built-in bluetooth support.  Will update the review later as I put the laptop to use.  Update: 1)Battery life is poor. 2)Below average speaker quality. 3)No bluetooth. 4)Not had any problems with Vista(yet). 4)Graphics performance is good for a laptop with integrated graphics w/shared memory(Good job, Intel). 5)Lots of pre-installed junk. 6)Many websites with streaming videos won't work with opera/Firefox. I think it is Windows Media player issue. 7)IE stops accepting mouse input sometimes, only way out is to restart IE. 8)Mouse key is hard and noisy.  With all these I would say it is still excellent overall, barring battery life.
__label__4 Ditched my Dell -- went for the new MacBook  So after 3 Dell PCs...I thought it was time to change it up and go back to a Mac. PLUS I thought, do I really want to deal with bloated Vista?  The new Mac book has been great -  here are my pros and cons:  Pros: - Simple to use, user friendly - Sharp looking laptop, awesome 13" screen, good processor, DVD, and webcam all built-in and working seemlessly - iLife and iWorks cover 90% of tasks needed - Handles photos MUCH better than a PC - Great battery life - You can run Windows XP or Vista if really needed  Cons: - Almost no OS X game software available (Not sure whats up with that since Sim City was BORN on Macs 20 years ago!)..of course you can run Windows software if needed via bootcamp/parallels - Add-ons are white, so it doesnt match my nice black color MacBook - semi-pricey options: power adapters, keyboards, etc  I was disappointed that Mac game Software is so limited. But really -- when you think about it, all you need is basic iworks software and an internet browser these days to do 99% of things you want to do. Plus I do have a windows option available.  Overall -- Great laptop, does what I want to do, has a great size and is much better quality than a Dell. Plus it can run Windows XP or Vista as well.
__label__1 hate it
__label__3 Great but not as I expected  The laptop has great ram (3 GB), great processor (rated at 6 GHz but runs at 4GHZ when needed), great ergonomics and design but what I hated is the card. I have never seen a played in a computer that has a so cheap IGP (integrated graphic card) as the 7150m.  It is a little better than my eMachines desktop of almost 4 years but not as much as I expected, but I least I can play games in the lowest resolutions with all desactivated (it does not good good at all). And to run Vista Aereo you need at least a 3.0 rated card ant it is rated at 2.9 for Aereo and 2.5 for games.  And other bad thing, Vista, because without it, the laptop could perform way better in processing and graphically (that is why many games require better graphic card for vista to play a game with the same graphics with a lower card on XP).  To finish, this is a good laptop for a person that will do anything except playing demanding games as COD4 (playing but looks kinda bad).
__label__1 Very bad Experience  This was my worst experience in buying from Amazon, It is very bad product and I wish to return it back but unfortunatlly it I moved to Jordan and it will cost me allot to return it back.  The VGA memory is so bad that I cannot view full screen video, it will blink like a Pentium one pc.  When you turn or revolve the tablet screen it will change all the icon position and scramble them by itself.  The tablet pen slot was broken and nor working FROM DAY ONE I receive my computer.  The Wireless range is very bad compared with all my HP pavilions that I owned before!.  DON'T count on the 3 GB Ram installed in it, The computer is ultra SLOW, may be because it is AMD, but believe me it is very slow computer.  I lost my Bluetooth connection and then I discovered that it was broken! after 3 weeks from the day I got it.  The default display settings is 1280 by 800 and it is so small display causing your eyes tiredness and illness unless you change it to lower resolution then you will see that every thing will be pixcelize and the whole image will have distortion.  The computer FAN will not stop or be quite, it is all ways HOT, even if you are not running any software, and that will cause the battery discharge in less that one hour, it is always like this.  that is the troth, I think all people who buy this computer faced the same things.  Regards,
__label__5 An amazing laptop!!!  Pros;  Battery life is long, FAST, fast, fast, goreous screen, Mac OS X, built -in Wifi and Bluetooth.  Cons:  Small HD(but easily upgraded, just pull out the hard drive and replace it with any size HD you wish.) and not much base ram. (1gb seems to be the sweetspot.)  This laptop is an amzing piece of technology. It runs Windows XP( although I don't know why in the world if you have Omac's OS X youd even want XP.) It has exceptional battery life, (5 hours plus.) The MacBook can hadle anything you throw at it. Running several programs all at once is no problem. The machine runs quiet and cool and since APple has fixed the random shut down issues that early models had its a very reliable computer. Like all Apple computer and products, youll look good while using your Mac. Some of the most amzing looking things come out of that company and you'll be the envy of the office, classroom, or jobsite when you pull this machine out. People just love asking you about it.
__label__3 Harder to use than I expected  Reading about this netbook gave me the impression that all you have to do is turn it on and voila! -- you're on the Internet.  Not hardly.  The product came with practically no documentation.  Connecting to the Net involved a call to the manufacturer and manually entering about 50 numbers in order to get the 3G connectivity I paid for.  A real nightmare.  It did, at least, have a very short help screen that explained how to use the touchpad to move up and down on a page and how to cut and paste.  But that's about it.  That said, it is a nice little netbook that I'll use when traveling.
__label__3 To many scrash all over Battery .only 2.30min The rest is good
__label__3 Basic computer, not good for ripping CD's  Hello all!  I purchased this laptop because my HP had served me well, but was beaten up due to battle.  It is a decent laptop, but right out of the box I notice the one thing that is bothering me is it hangs up.  It gets frozen.  This is odd, because it is new, and it has 2.2 processor speed.  It is not good at running multiple apps, so beware.  I bought it for surfing, word processing, to upload music, and manage my iphone stuff.  It is ok for surfing, word processing, but not for ripping CD's or managing itunes stuff.  It is just too slow for some reason.  IT will get me through, but I wished I had spent just 300 more dollars and got another HP.  It is not soo heavy, screen looks decent,it has a pinch feature on the touchpad, which is interesting.  Good luck!
__label__2 Needs better Touch Pad  Considering the individual components and aspects, I really like the Acer Chromebook, but there are a couple of significant problems affecting my use.  Speed -- The latest Samsung models, including their new Chromebox, were just released sporting a new processor. From what I understand, they're a few times faster. That said, I certainly don't mind the speed of this one. It's not snappy by any means, but it doesn't feel sluggish either.  Build quality -- For a $300 device, it's just right. The casing is certainly nothing to write home about: dull and unmistakably plastic. But again, for $300, it's fine. Most importantly, the screen sharpness and brightness are quite reasonable, if not spectacular; the overall case doesn't feel flimsy; the keyboard doesn't flex; and the key throw is good. I also like the key layout although I miss some dedicated keys, such as Home and End. Personal preferences aside, for the price, the hardware was up to par except for the...  Touch Pad -- I found it virtually unusable. It's the main reason I am returning my machine. When set to interpret taps as mouse-button pushes, it misses half of the time. I constantly have to look back at the screen to see whether my selection has taken. The alternative of pressing down on the pad, which is in essence a giant button, isn't attractive because the button is too stiff and sounds like it's a few clicks away from breaking. The two-finger scrolling functionality is even worse. It moves so quickly and imprecisely that there's no way, for example, to easily read a long galley on a web page without it suddenly scrolling too far. I always have to click in the page and use the cursor arrows.  Applications -- My primary machine runs Linux. I wanted to have a backup machine (that didn't require any maintenance, updates, etc.) while also having something for guests. For a lot of people, internet, email, and Dropbox access is all they need, and the Chrome OS concept is perfect for that. There are some nice applications for text editing and such. Many of them, though, feel like you're editing on a webpage as opposed to operating like real programs (Fisher-Price versus Festool). In the feel department, some of that is because, as an application itself, the Chrome browser hogs a majority of the available keyboard shortcuts. So, for example, if you're trying to use a text-editor that lives inside of the Chrome browser, there's not a shot at having a full range of logical keyboard equivalents available, as the text-editor has to live with whatever Chrome hasn't taken for itself. That leads us to...  Users -- For casual users, who don't use keyboard shortcuts, the above-mentioned problem of applications living inside of a browser might not be a problem unless, of course, you need a program that doesn't run inside of browsers. In fact, the very friendly and clean keyboard layout would be un-intimidating and ideal, as in something perfect for older parents. For those who use just a few shortcuts, it's probably fine as well, albeit mildly inconvenient on occasion. If you're a fairly intensive keyboard user, the conflict of apps running inside of the Chrome browser will likely be annoying and tremendously inconvenient, especially while using text and/or code editors. On the other hand, if you are VIM user, you probably would use the Chromebook's terminal to directly connect with your server, thus bypassing the browser, so there would be no issue whatsoever.  Summary -- In my humble opinion, non-technical users who want a simple, reliable, and reasonably fast method for accessing internet and email could be quite pleased. Same for someone who just needs a backup machine in a pinch. Same for someone looking for a guest room machine. Same for someone who looks forward to not maintaining a computer and who wants consistent performance (in contrast to the self-slowing, eventually dragging Windows or any OS bogged down with anti-virus programs). For technical folks hoping for a production machine, you might not be so pleased, although the lack of setup and maintenance is surely attractive. (I gotta say it was quite cool to pull the machine out of its box, enter my Google logon, and see all of my email and browser bookmarks instantly appear.) And, for extremely technical folks who can use VIM and short wires to produce binary code, this is a very reasonable tool, especially because it would be hard to beat the price. Lastly, anyone who wants to run programs versus apps (i.e., things that don't run in Chrome) obviously wouldn't be pleased at all.
__label__1 I won't to return these product it's not work
__label__1 Received packaged tried it out / it was not working wouldnt trust buying a used one / completely unhappy
__label__3 beautiful but too small  A beautiful computer. Thin, light, does not overheat. Turns on in seconds. Super fast and quiet.  I loved this computer but returned it because the fonts on the toolbar and everywhere were just too small with no real way of adjusting them. I also felt it was too small overall for comfortable use.  I wish Apple would make a MacBook Air in a 15 or 17" size. That would be amazing and eliminate the problem with the fonts being too small.
__label__1 very bad computer has not worked right since day one and wants to give me a 85 percent refund don't order from this company
__label__5 Excellent condition  I bought one of this laptops from Midwest Notebooks two weeks ago. It is in perfect condition: fast, reliable--as apposed to a Windows PC--I just turned it on, it asked for the wireless password, and in 10 seconds I was on line. I don't regret having bought this computer specially because I needed one for my classroom presentation
__label__4 Nice machine  This is a really nice piece of kit. Its stable, screen is good and clear and with the right adapter connects to any projector which is useful and looks really stylish when giving presentations or lectures etc. Is a must buy with iWork. Plus I found a good book on getting started and using macs&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Mountain-Lion-Macs-Computer-Training/dp/B00C3FLCCK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Mountain Lion Macs (Computer Training)</a>
__label__2 awful touchpad ruins an otherwise nice laptop  This is a really nice looking, solid, well constructed computer, but the touchpad ruins it. The touchpad is way too large, and it is too easy to accidentally brush it with one finger whilst typing or using another finger to try to point at something. This makes even very simple tasks unnecessarily error-prone. I can't begin to express how frustrating this is.  Web pages are constantly being zoomed in our out of accidentally. Emails get sent while they're half written. And in typing any given sentence, you have a good chance of finding yourself suddenly finishing the sentence in the middle of the previous paragraph.
__label__4 Terrific little laptop!  This is the best little laptop when you want to have quick access to the web when traveling or even just out and about. It is very durable and fits easily into a shoulder bag or purse. It can be brought out wherever there is wi-fi--the airport, in a hotel room, or your local library. The screen is small but the resolution is excellent. This is not a substitute for a full-size laptop, but its durability and size make it perfect for the traveler who just wants to check email or a few web sites while on the road.
__label__3 Dell Latitude Laptop  I am grateful that I made the choice of purchasing this laptop. Amazon is just great and they will remain my number one business choice. It's time that others who have doubts take the chacne and make a purchase and they will see the difference. What I admired most was the fact that the items suit the description that were posted on the website and the good thing is that the timely delivery of these items was excellent. Amazon, you are great!
__label__4 Excellent laptop with only a few weaknesses  The MacBook is a high quality machine with only a few flaws. It is fast, compact, lightweight, and well-designed. Have no fear about the keyboard. It's excellent, despite its non-conventional looks. The glossy screen is beautiful; despite using it in a wide range of settings, I have no problems with glare. I only have two complaints: one is that the black finish collects fingerprints rather easily. It's not bad enough that I wish I had selected the white machine instead, but it's something Apple could work on for the next revision. The last is the "mooing" sound that many have commented on. It seems to be a problem only when the laptop is plugged in, but it's still annoying. I've put a complete review up on techrecs.com, but the most important thing is to take a look at the laptop in person for yourself.
__label__4 happy with purchase  Was not my first choice..but I'm glad I got it...lacks bluetooth but works well...fast and hasn't given any problems..love the smooth ceramic finish..
__label__2 Some Things Not Right  I half to press buttons more then one time to write .with that being said im slightly unhappy with that
__label__2 Laptop  This is a totally stripped down laptop.  No programs.  By the time you buy and load the programs, it will cost more than a new one.  Just too late to send it back.  Going to donate it to a school for their use.
__label__2 Full of excitement, was sorely disapponted  so I got my brand new shiny titan silver (grey) Samsung series 5 chromebook in today. I went to boot it up, it had to update it's software which took a couple minutes and then it promptly let me login and start going. So far so good? right? no. first of all, the build of the product does see sturdy to an extent. I can see why some people would say it feels a bit cheap to the touch. the biggest issue I had with the device is that i went to initiate the camera on the computer, and not only didn't recognize the webcam, it froze the entire computer. and before everyone starts yelling about disabling 10.2 flash, yes i did my homework and did tons of troubleshooting to no avail, after about an hour on the phone with samsung, they told me that i would have to do a complete recovery on my brand new chromebook. I decided that this wasn't a good start to the relationship and am returning it tomorrow. I am not going to say that overall it seems to be a pretty nice unit, the trackpad is a bit too big IMO, it takes up a good 1/3 of the space at the bottom of the keyboard and when i was using it, i seemed to always be bumping my hand into it when typing. another thing i noticed is that when i was in the 'file shelf' there was not a delete function which struck me as odd. I had high hopes for the product but had a disappointing letdown. maybe next gen Google and Samsung.
__label__5 Sony Vaio SZ430N  I am on my third laptop, where the first two were Dell machines.  Each a very good machine and a capable replacement of a desktop machine.  However, this time I was looking for something as powerful and light weight.  After doing plenty of research SZ430N came up as a winner in my eyes.  Simple examination of pictures and spec can give me plenty of good information but there is nothing like seeing and touching the product.  Hence, I was a bit nervous when clicking on the "buy" button for an item over $2K.  However, once it arrived and I started to use it, all of my prior concerns went away.  This machine is absolutely perfect.  A nice and crisp screen gives ample working area.  The dual processor is fast and responsive.  The fan is quiet.  The keyboard is large and feels very comfortable to wright.  Most importantly it is only 4lbs :D  To be clear, I don't play games but do use it for work that is, programming, presentations, and editing text files.  This must be very boring job for this machine, and I am sure that it can do much much more.  Drawbacks.  Surprisingly this machine comes with a lot of useless software installed!  I am very disappointed.  It even came with 4 moves that need to be unlocked for a price!!  (Each movie is over a gig.)  For this price a company that takes part in production of movies, could afford to put few free moves.  Of course the "cancer" AOL software was setup.  Other free-trail things are installed as well.  For a person who is not very comfortable with uninstalling programs this could be an waste of space and affect overall satisfaction with this very nice product.
__label__3 Not so fast  I was very excited to get this laptop.  The first day it was very quick, but since has slowed down consideralby.  Not sure why this happens, but very frustrating when it should be running faster.  I've taken programs and games off that I'm not using, but doesn't help.  My HP was quicker.
__label__1 All 8 HP Pavilion DV64XXXX  models refer to the same cutomer reviews!  Dear Amazon,  All 8 of the HP DV64XXXX models share the same customer reviews?  As of 8/27/07, there were 17 customer reviews and regardless of which model is picked from the dropdown, the same 17 customer reviews are displayed.  Unless the reviewer specifically included the model number in their review, how is anyone supposed to make sense of the reviews?  On top of that...4 out of 5 stars are given for model number ????  I guess it's buyer beware...
__label__5 Beautiful!! Completely Worth it!  I bought this Macbook, and since the first day I received it, I was so happy...It's beautiful on the outside and it's perfect on the inside. And it comes with Leopard, that is simply the best OS ever. I highly recommend this Mac for anyone... Buy It, because it's totally worth it!!
__label__1 it was fine at first  I ordered 2 gave one to a friend returned mine because I got a constant blue screen can not wait til I get a comp of my own
__label__5 Love my Mac Book Pro!  I'm so glad I bought this used Mac Book instead of a new one. It's works as good and maybe even a little better than my old one.  I would still be using my 2011 MacBook except the battery died completely, began swelling and warped the case. It was way out of warranty so no luck getting it replaced. Personally I hate the new MacBooks and would never spend that much on something with few ports and no DVD/CD drive. Call me old fashion but I still listen to books on CD and play movies on DVD.  Also the company, Hope computers, was very helpful and the laptop was packed very well.  The only problem was the signature required to pick it up, being in a rural area and working a full-time job made it difficult to get to the post office. But overall I'm very satisfied with my Mac Book Pro.
__label__2 Quit working  I was very pleased with this computer when it arrived. It came within just a few days and I had reason to contact the seller prior to shipment and he responded quickly. However, the screen went black after about 60 days. It appeared that the computer itself was working because you could see the lights blinking but nothing on the screen. I contacted the seller asking if there was anything he might be willing to do but I've not received a reply and that was over 2 months ago. This is very disappointing after spending the money for this item and not being able to use it at all. Being retired and on a fixed income means we need to watch our purchases - we think this item should have lasted longer than a couple of months.

__label__2 it doesn't work fast like a regular computer  Don't buy it. Just bc it is an apple computer, it doesn't work fast like a regular computer. Takes forever to surf the Internet. If you want a newer Apple, buy the newer versions. So much better!
__label__2 my webcam does not work  the webcam built inside of the computer will not stay on it goes into stztic and then back to normal again its a lot topaz for a device that doesn't work properly .
__label__1 Waste of coin, just another cheap laptop.  When I say cheap im not refering to the price only the quality of the Dell laptop.  The design looks like a childresn toy and it;s made with the same unreliable, cheap hardware that is housed within all Dell products.  The hardware is too unreliable and fails within months making this a throw away laptop.  It looks stupid and the performance was very minimally exceptional.  The wireless card in both this and my XPS failed within a month of eachother and was never that great in the first place, the screens were very, very delicate, the xps screen cracked and failed in 6 months and becasue of Dell's pooor service I have it hooked to a monitor just to use it. This Adamo laptop is displaying the same issues.  A dell laptop weather it's costs 1600+ dollars or 300 dollars is made with the same cheap hardware, your being ripped off. = Avoid.
__label__4 Toshiba laptop  Bought it for my wife and she loves it. Sound quality for a laptop is excellent. The only negative so far is that our wireless mouse still  requires a plug in module instead of having a built in capability. The module is subject to damage when  handling.
__label__5 easy to use  Easy to use and so portable. My first experience with Linux. I already use Firefox. I love my 22" monitor and Windows XP, but this little guy is just a joy. Turned it on in my apartment and easily found a wireless connection. A go anywhere computer it won't fit easily into your pants pocket but it's still easy to carry around. I have no need for a full size laptop so this fits the bill. Very pleased.
__label__3 Lots of scratches and my screen was scratched
__label__5 Toshiba - great laptop  Great lap-top, but 1gb ram is not enough.  Too slow.  I happened to have 2 GB from another laptop and I swapped it.  Then it ran like a dream!
__label__1 Broken Laptop on Arrival  I purchase this laptop based on the overview reviews - positive feedback - for my niece. I purchased the product from J and J computing and the laptop was not working properly. The product description stated refurbish but not quite right. When the laptop arrived it was turned on but nothing booted up not a good sign. Laptop was turned off and then restarted and work good. The following day same problem. I received a refund but I had to pay for  postage to return a broken laptop. I recommend not to purchase from J and J computing.
__label__5 Met expectations Son very pleased with it
__label__2 Over rated, over priced but pretty  Just so you can have an idea of my computer knowledge, I work in the IT industry and have been for 25 years.  I used to use and sell Apple products and was a big fan of how easy they were to use and get support for.  Then, due to employers preferences, I was given Windows PC's and used them until Oct. 2012 when starting a new job and I was given a MacBook Air 13".  This summer (June 2014) I purchased a used 2011 MacBook Pro 15" with 500GB HD, 8GB RAM, i7 Intel processor.  My review of this MacBook Pro comes after a few months of use, conversation with other Mac users, searching online for support of issues I've been having.  In short, I now wish I hadn't bought this MacBook.  In my opinion, PC's have been made easier to use than the MacOS allows.  I realize this is an opinion and will describe the issues I've had.  Also, I realize that long time Mac people will have knowledge that I don't so my review may be more relevant to others like me, who are thinking of moving from a PC to a Mac.  Some issues we had at my company with Mac's compatibility with Windows based applications made me hesitant to buy this MacBook Pro but I wanted to have more capability to do HD movie editing and friends and business associates unanimously told me that the Mac is the way to go.  I'm no pro at movie editing by any means and am only using iMovie which I had to buy though it usually is included on Macs when you buy them new.  My first impression is of how well the hardware looks and seems very sturdy in it's construction.  It's solid on that front, probably better than any others on the market aside from ruggedized portable computers.  My MBP came with Microsoft Outlook included which was a requirement I had.  I don't use this Mac for my job, but I hate web based mail because of the many limitations in comparison to a native (local) inbox residing on my computer.  The first thing I found out after setting up Outlook for my Email is that many features that I used at least hourly on a WinPC are just not available on the Mac version.  The next thing I found was that even after what, 20 years of Outlook for Mac being on the market, there are still major issues with the program running on the Mac.  It constantly loses connection and can't reconnect to the MSN server.  It's not an issue with my router or anything else, it's solely the Mac and Outlook.  I make a point of this because in my research I've found that tons of people are having the same issues and neither Microsoft nor Apple are interested in dealing with them.  It's very, very frustrating.  Google Chrome: I have never liked Apple's Safari browser.  To me it seems an infant in a land of professionals, but again that's my opinion.  Internet Explorer isn't perfect, and it's definitely the target of every hacker on the planet, but it has features and compatibility that apparently Safari will never achieve.  I have been using Chrome for a few years almost exclusively, except when a web site isn't compatible and until recently had no problems with Chrome.  On the MacOS (I have Mavericks) Chrome "works" but there are issues immediately.  On my Mac, every single time I click to open Chrome, I get a warning message that has to be clicked away before Chrome will start.  The message is warning about programs downloaded from the internet.  The only fix I've found for this requires command line programming and risk of a mistake could cause further issues.  This is for an extremely common application that has been around for years and years.  Again, neither Google nor Apple seem to care enough to want to deal with this issue.  Performance: This is one area where I feel this Mac does well.  I won't say it's "better" than a PC of the same specs, but it's not worse either.  Mac's do manage RAM (memory) better than PC's in my opinion.  On a WinPC, 8GB of RAM running Win7 is the minimum you should have.  Any less, and you won't be able to run much of anything other than the OS.  On my Mac, I think 4GB probably would have handled 99% of what I do but with 8GB I never even get close to hitting the limit even with 12 Chrome tabs open, MS Word and Excel running as well as iMessage, iMovie and iTunes.  This is a huge "positive" to me.  I would likely need 12-16GB of RAM on a Win8 PC.  I have very limited experience with Win8 but I hated it to be perfectly frank.  I wish I had gone with a 13" version of this computer.  The 15" is very heavy in my opinion.  I certainly don't want to travel with it.  The MacBook Air was great for travel though.  The MacOS used to be very intuitive, with easy to figure out and use features.  That was quite a few years ago but I expected it to only be even easier to figure out by now.  That is not the case.  To my surprise, many simple tasks that I took for granted on my WinPC are a royal pain and require at least twice as many steps to accomplish.  This applies to file management, save, locate & open, attachments, etc.  Just simple things that were "one click" in Win7 are multiple steps without obvious means of accomplishing them.  Any attempt to obtain help for the issues I've had has resulted in my being channeled to Apple's online support "community".  My experience there has been dismal.  If you're not a die-hard Apple fanatic, you get condescension, ridicule, and elitist attitudes.  Interacting with an actual Apple employee seems to be impossible unless you pay more money.  This was the case with my iPhone which I bought new, so I already knew what to expect there.  Even under the iPhones pathetic 90 day warranty, I was treated like I was yesterday's trash.  I've been to the local Apple store's Genius Bar.  When I finally got to see the actual guy who was going to address the issue I was having, he was polite, knowledgeable and quickly identified the cause and fixed that issue.  However, that was after I got passed the initial contact person at the front of the store which made my blood boil.  She asked what I needed, I told her that I was having issues with my device and needed support.  She proceeds to sell me another one of the same thing I showed her!  This is Apple Culture and I feel it is relevant to anybody considering buying an Apple product for the first time.  I like the configuration of this MacBook Pro though 2 USB ports seems insufficient.  I will probably never use the FireWire port so that is wasted on me at least.  I've always liked the magnetic charging AC connector.  Very, very cool.  No friction and it just seems to work flawlessly.  I don't have the Retina Display but have seen those on others and I just don't see the need for that expense for my purposes.  The anti-glare screen on my MBP is great.  Very low reflection makes it easier to read in more light conditions.  The Wi-Fi seems to work great.  Even when Outlook loses it's connection constantly, my browser always is connected and when waking from sleep mode, the Wi-Fi fires up quickly and connects.  I don't use iCloud so I have no comments regarding that on this Mac.  iMovie is a decent low end video editor.  I find the "Help" feature on every Apple product I own to be virtually useless, and the iMovie Help perpetuates that opinion for me.  I found much better help in using iMovie on YouTube than anything Apple provides.  When I enter search terms in Apple's "Help" field, it almost never returns relevant results.  I don't know if I speak the wrong language or what the issue is, but their Help feature is just a waste of space to me.  Still, after viewing some YouTube videos, I was quickly able to create movies with my HD video clips that were fun to make and share with friends & family.  Summary: For the fun stuff like creating movies, viewing pictures, playing music, etc, this MacBook Pro has been good.  It is meeting expectations on those items.  For business and productivity applications, I'm sorry to say the Mac is still light years behind Windows PC's comparably equipped.  And PC's are still lower priced than Mac's, and there is still a lot more productivity software for PC's than for the Mac.  Those that are available on both platforms have significantly less features in the Mac version than are commonly used on PC versions.  Support is just pathetic in my opinion.  To me, it feels like Apple just doesn't want to hear any negativity about their products.  That may explain their silent treatment when ever anything negative makes the news.  I am trying to move from an 8 year old HP PC to this Mac, and it has been a very painful process.  When I needed support for my HP PC, I was stunned how fast I had a live person on the phone who was based in the U.S. and English was their first language.  Support calls were efficient, concise, friendly and SUPPORTIVE.  My experience with Apple's support has been ineffective, condescending, used car salesman like, and on one occasion the Apple support person caused another issue for which he was unwilling to resolve.  Fashion appears to be one of the top selling points of Apple products.  I like cool looking products as much as anyone, but my first requirement is productivity when it comes to a computer.  In that regard, I've been greatly underwhelmed by this MacBook Pro.  Getting things done inevitably requires me to get support or education to use this thing, both of which are costly and aggravating to obtain.  On my PC, that seemed pretty easy to obtain and get going on what I needed to accomplish.  Because of this factor, I don't feel this is a good product for me.  Anyone have an i7 laptop PC you'd like to trade??
__label__5 OK - this is the home run laptop  I just replaced a whole pile of older Apple gear (including a 500 MHz IceBook) with this model (the G4/667/DVD).  It was well worth it.  The iBook is a great Mac for the money, but the newest PowerBook G4 systems are just great Macs, period.  The speed is fast for virtually any task, and OS X 10.1 is snappy in a way that the G3-based systems can't touch.  The improved Radeon Mobility video (with double the VRAM of the older G4) improves display performance, and mirroring is snappy, without the lag that some mirrored displays have been known to show.  It fully supports the resolution of the Apple Cinema display (with an adapter, though - the Powerbook only has VGA out).  Performance on the latest builds of the OS X DVD player is excellent thus far, and it can use the full screen for a simulated 16:9 effect.  Built-in networking options include 10/100/1000 (!) Ethernet, an included V.90 modem, and an integrated AirPort card supporting 128-bit WEP (broken though WEP is). Apple also addressed most of the design flaws from the original G4 series - the port cover in the back now has slits machined into it for better ventilation, the body flexes a little less, and disc alignment doesn't seem to be the problem it was in some earlier models.  AirPort range is improved, though still nowhere near as good as what you can get with the iBook series - the antennas are quite limited by the metal case (Faraday cage, anyone?).  The new power adapter is a big improvement over the previous "flying saucer" design, as well.  Chances are good that you'll never need to connect anything to the built-in Cardbus slot, but one is provided in case 1 6-pin Firewire port, 2 USB ports, VGA and S-Video out, and the integrated Ethernet, modem and wireless aren't enough for you.  Go figure. What can I quibble about?  Well, I still hope they find a better way to integrate the AirPort antenna.  A DVD/CD-RW combo drive like the one in the iBook would be nice - but apparently none currently are available to fit the super-slim slot-loading format the G4 uses.  Heat distribution isn't bad, but the back right corner can occasionally get uncofortable under heavy use.  And finally, the keyboard is held in place by magnets as well as the little clips Apple uses - those magnets attach with adhesive to the keyboard bottom (and grab the metal in the inner case), and have a habit of the adhesive getting loose.  Easily fixed, but a little annoying.  Really nothing I'd take points away for. All in all, this is by far the best laptop I've used or owned (and I've had a lot of them).  No, the G4 doesn't offer the sheer processing speed of the latest mobile Pentium and Athlon processors, but the combination of a spectacular screen, light weight, good battery life, and general engineering isn't matched by anything on the market I know of.  As an added bonus, the PowerBook G4 even runs Virtual PC very well if you really need Windows in your life.
__label__4 HP Pavilion zv6130us 15.4" Notebook PC (AMD Athlon 64 Processor 3200+, 512 MB RAM, 80 GB Hard Drive, DVD+/-R/RW and CD-RW Combo  This laptop is a great laptop. I recently graduated for InterActive Media Design. And it's been a great help for me. I'm using Adobe softwares and Dreamweaver softwares and the processor speed is pretty faast. Although the battery life doesnt last that long, it's still pretty good for design softwares and for movies too because of its widescreen. And its not bad for playing games too. It has a lot of hard drive. Great graphics. great laptop.
__label__1 Terrible  Terrible worked for only a day
__label__5 Best $400 ever spent  This little PC is just amazing!!  I had been watching this product since before the holiday season just to see if the price would drop or if new models would be release either before/after CES.  My original hesitation about the purchase was the keyboard.  I can honestly say that the first few hours were really really bad.  It was quite frustrating to learn where the keys are on a small keyboard.  However, after just setting up the PC and doing some surfing I found myself flying on the keyboard.  The shipping OS, a modified version of Xandros, was actually quite good.  Anything that you could want is on there and adding additional programs was really easy. I kept it for about a day and played with the easy and advanced versions before making the move to a custom installation of Ubuntu.  Overall the hardware is really amazing.  It has more than enough power to run all of the cool desktop effects that come packaged in Compiz-fusion.  As soon as receiving the PC, I upgraded the memory to 1GB and added a Kingston 4GB SD card.  Like everyone has mentioned, you will get looks and asked what it is.  It is a lot of fun to explain to them what it is and then when they ask price to see their face.  Most of them think it costs much much more that what you pay.  My only concern is about the product walking off.  I take it to class everyday in my laptop bag.  I use to just leave my bag on my chair when I would go and talk with other students or the professor.  However, now that everyone knows that I have one and seeing the reaction towards it, I have a hard time letting it out of my sight.  Overall this is the best $400 I have ever invested into a PC.
__label__1 Waiting  I orderedy laptop about a month ago. I'm still waiting. Today I looked at my email and it said I didn't order it. It still took my money and now I get no laptop. I ordered it again a few minutes ago.
__label__1 Laptop more damaged than advertised will return for refund
__label__3 n o upgrade recieved  Never got the upgrade promissed to the new operating system as advertised computer good but would like upgrade advertised for product
__label__1 Beware  Came very dirty. When clean it looked nice. But BEWARE the OPERATING SYSTEM IS TOO OLD TO OPEN BASIC PROGRAMS AND WEBSITES AND CANNOT BE UPDATED TO A MORE RECENT OPERATING SYSTEM DO YOUR HOMEWORK
__label__1 DO NOT PURCHASE ANY REFURBISHED LAPTOPS FROM TECH GALAXY, LLC!!!!  DO NOT PURCHASE ANY REFURBISHED LAPTOPS FROM TECH GALAXY, LLC!!!! They are using faulty parts. The Airport Card stopped working after 3 months, and the hard drive is on its way out. Save yourself from the aggravation and purchase from Apple directly.
__label__3 Too fancy to be good  Pros 1. 18" HD screen is very clear and bright 2. Fingerprint log feature is pretty nice. 3. With 7200rpm hard disk, this laptop runs like desktop. 4. With a full size keyboard. 5. Build in webcam 6. Lowest price compare other brand with same configuration Cons 1. I don't like these touch buttons on the keyboard at all. Slow response or response by wrong way all the time. I have to be very careful how many times touch on that volume touch button. It has to wait for CPU available to take sound adjustment request processor. A normal mechanical button is more efficient. 2. Wireless connection comes and goes. I guess that is windows vista's common issue. 3. DVD player interface is so bad; actually, HP media DVD player is the worst DVD player software I have even seen, which shows HP is really not a software company! Player does NOT allow use mouse to do most of DVD normal function and remote control doesn't work at all in most of time. Backward, forward can only go one speed.  And every time I want to change movie feature (add subtitle), DVD will restart from beginning. 4. HDMI output doesn't include sound, only video. 5. You can put second hard disk in this laptop. But it's not wired. 6. Not indication bar on screen shows screen brightness level during adjustment Overall conclusion Performance is pretty good as a laptop stand. Good for doing some serious job, but not that good for entertainment purpose.
__label__4 A compilation of all reviews  After reading all of the reviews I have come to the following conclusions.  1: Apple's operating system is light years ahead of Windows    XP or Linux.  2: You will need to purchase the extra 256 megs of RAM and the    60 gig HD.  3: Unless you want to really screw up your computer, forget    trying to outsmart the engineers at Apple and buy Apple    products or approved Apple products.  4: You will never have a virus. It's impossible to get one!    The nature of the operating system makes receiving a virus    impossible.  5: The system will almost never crash and is easier and more    pleasant to use than any other.  6: Everything works seamlessly.  7: For this convenience and superiority you will pay more up    front for everything and less on the back end. Quality costs.  8: Ben Franklin said that he always bought the best and most    expensive item. It is always cheaper in the long run.
__label__2 Not as great as I thought  This laptop is OK, but definitely not what I thought for the features.  I am still getting used to Windows 7, but for some reason, I keep having difficulty accessing the internet.  I always get a prompt that says "Internet Explorer cannot display this page".  Not exactly sure what the issue is here.
__label__2 Never buy a Lenolo computer again  My IdeaPad Ultrabook comes with 8GB of DRAM, 32 GB SSD, 1 TB HDD, Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bits.  (1) Right of the bat, I had to install tons of  updates from Windows. That's understandable and typical for Windows PC and I have no problem with that. The thing I want to complain about is the updates keep failing. And When Windows tells you there are xnumber of updates are available, I just pick a number for the purpose of explaining, says 64 updates are available, if somewhere along the line, just 1 update failed, the whole thing crashed. When you reboot the computer, the Lenovo automatically restores to the old software or driver. For example if the first 30 updates were successful and the 31st update failed, when you reboot the computer, it will restore the 30 successful updates back to the previous version without asking you want to keep the 30 good updates of not. The only way to get around is to run the update ONE BY ONE if you don't want to junk all the good updates that were successfully installed.  (2) I like to leave comments on Yahoo! News stories and also leave comments on Facebook. This damn Lenovo always always and always freezes when I leave comments on Yahoo! stories or Facebook. I've searched on Google and even the Windows/MS website for a solution. Nothing ever works.  (3) So when Windows 8 came out, I was among the first user to upgrade my IdeaPad to Windows 8 hoping to fix all my problems once and for all. Not only all my problems are still there, now I have a very tough time to connect to the internet. Although the signal strength are at full bars on the status line. The Lenovo refuses to connect and keeps saying no internet connection. Or if I'm lucky enough to get this ultrabook to connect, within minutes the connection will crap out. although as I said earlier, the signal strength is always full, you can't get the signal strength any fuller. In the end I had to get rid off Windows 8 and fall back to Windows 7. Of course I had to reinstall the hundreds of Windows updates ONE BY ONE. It took me weeks to get all the updates installed.  (4) Lately I've begun to receive error that says something about VBasic cannot be found or something to that extent Of course I've searched on the internet for solution(s). There are some suggestions but none ever work as expected.  To sum it up, this Lenovo IdeaPad U410 is a piece of crap. It's only 6 months old but I'm dreadful to turn it on. Sometimes I just let it sits collecting dust for 3 or 4 weeks without turning it on. Because if I gathered enough courage to turn it on, I'd likely have to turn it off within 15 minutes. So why bother?
__label__4 Good, Laptop for and Awsome Price.  This is my first laptop and I got to say, I like. I use to have a Desktop, but that crash on me, So, since I really don't have the room for it, I decied to go for this Toshiba Satillite a205 Notebook instead, and I got to say, I'm loving it. And for he price I got it (499.00), it was a steal.  The only drawback has to be the Itunes problem. I downloaded the program to burn cds, but I can't do it. I could import them using Itunes, but not burn the tracks onto a blank cd. I took it back to Best Buy so they could check it out, and they told me that it was a Vista thing, and that if I wanted to burn to just use Windows Media. I really don't mind, the reason I got Itunes was for my Ipod.  Aside form that, I like it. It's got a good amount of memory (120gbs) and if you don't mind Vista driving you crazy (I'm still used to XP), and if you're looking for a bargain, then this is the notebook for you.
__label__4 Love the Notebook, Sony Customer Service is TERRIBLE  This is my second Vaio.  Although a firm believer in Sony products, I will never purchase again.  I was having battery problems, so we contacted customer service.  After downloading a program to monitor the battery life, this program created a problem with some software I have.  After 3 hours on the phone with Sony, while they were in my computer through LOG ME IN. COM, they caused my computer to crash.  After crashing it, the tech told me to turn it off, wait 30 minutes and it should be okay.  Obviously this didn't work.  After another 2-1/2 hours of Sony quoting my warranty and disclaimers to me, their basic response was oops.  Sorry. My husband recovered the data and wiped the hard drive.  Everything is fine now, but after being a life-long Sony supporter their attitude and response to a problem they caused left a lot to be desired.  No more Sony for my family.
__label__2 Not working  The hard drive was not working. Didn't state in the  advertisement that the hard drive was damage. Don't know if it's working or not ,have to buy a hard drive first.
__label__3 Just not worth all that money  I used to be a Mac person, and then I converted over to PC. Because of husband pressure and advice from the Geek Squad, I ended up buying this MacBookPro, which I've been using for several weeks.  First off I do not like the silver plastic of this case. It feels cheap, and the computer runs so hot that I have to put a magazine under it to balance it on my lap. It really, really runs hot. I also don't like the old-fashioned matte screen, having been spoiled by my Acer's slick sharp screen. The screen is also smallish--although the diagonal measure is true, the depth of the screen is less than my other computers.  The model ships with BootCamp, which works great, although you will have to purchase Windows VISTA separately if you're going that way. I have partitioned my hard drive 50/50 Mac/PC and am experiencing no problems. I use the machine as a PC except for iPod and photos. Apple also provided decent in-computer speakers, thank heavens, so you can play videos without using supplementary speakers.  The keyboard is backlit in low light settings (you can turn this feature off). This is rather nice, but it doesn't make up for the touch of the keyboard, which doesn't feel all that great to me.  Now is this machine were 1/2 the price, things would be different. But at this price point, I really am looking for something that is a bit more perfect.
__label__1 Probably better for pros not for regular users  I am surprised that there are good reviews on Toshiba labtop, period. I used HP, Dell and Toshiba and I think the worst made is Toshiba. (Even their copy machine breaks down a lot at work). It's very sensitive and easily gets slowed down. It doesn't seem to like any antivirus software. If you leave it standing for just 15 minutes, you might as well restart; or else you will wait a very long time for each web page to download. I know that I am not a pro in computers but I didn't have problem with Dell or HP before. On top of it their tech support is terrible and totally not worth renewing the insurance. All I can say is that I will not get close to anything made by Toshiba in the future.
__label__3 Not too bad  Graphically it has taken everything i've thrown at it up until recently. The biggest gripe is the awful firmware update system. It simply doesn't work.  There are other minor ergo gripes. Power plug on the right hand side , not a big thing but its annoying when you're right handed and using an external mouse. Most thought out laptops will put the cable in the back or left hand side.  Numeric 10 key pad. Awesome idea right?! Well for the longest time these buttons were mapped to the normal number keys along the top. Not a horrible thing if all you use the keypad for is numbers and data entry. But if you hit the numlock key ............. the windows calculator comes up???? I think this has been addressed finally with a firmware update but again updating the firmware hasn't been easy.
__label__4 Good laptop for the price  I bought this toshiba satellite a205-s5804 at bestbuy for $450 a couple of months ago. After making several research, this laptop seems to be the best for tis price. I upgraded the ram to 2 GB , I bought kingston 1gb kvr667d2s5/1g from Newegg for $18.99/each, I installed it with no problem. This is my second laptop after my IBM R40, i guess it makes sense to buy a new laptop than to repair the old one. So far, I have no problem. I disabled all the startup program except the sidebar, and my computer opens fast. The only problem I had was, I was not aware that you have to turn on the wireless internet connection by switching on a button that is on the front edge of the notebook, it lights up once you have it on. I have to use a cordless mouse because the tab on the mouse pad is not soft to touch and you will hear a loud tapping sound everytime you press on it. I have a black laptop, with a white keyboard. I never realize that it is easier to read the letters on the keyboard when it is white. Keyboard is soft to touch and wide enough for people with big fingers. The sound is good, after my experience with the IBM's lousy sound. I like the wheel on the front edge of the notebook to adjust the sound.
__label__5 One of my best purchases ever  I've been a Windows user my whole life and decided that I would take the plunge and go with Mac for college. I had played around with OSX on a friend's laptop and it was love at first sight. The Macbook is sleek, compact, and fast.  The wireless connection (Airport) is fully compatible with a, b, and g networks. It works with no problems at home and school.  The Mac looks and works great. Overheating is a problem because it gets too hot to keep on your lap and the fans turn on at full blast.  If you're thinking of buying a Mac, buy it for the OS. It's intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, and fun to use. Personally, I feel the black Macbook is worth the extra $200 since it won't get dirty and need it's front panels (where you rest your wrists) replaced and for the larger hard drive (80GB instead of 60).
__label__1 DONT BOTHER BUYING!!!  1 star rating because at least my refund was processed the same day as the return. I got the MacBook a day earlier than expected, yet the thing didn't turn on AT ALL. The charger lit up. Barrera showed it was fully charged, but MacBook - dead!! Absolutely disappointed - DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!!!!
__label__1 Terrible Customer Service  Do not buy  Toshiba Satellite A505-S6973 laptops (or any Toshiba, for that matter).  My laptop is less than one year old and so should be covered under the manufacturer's warranty.  When I called Toshiba & described the issue I was having, they knew exactly what the problem was--the input jack for the DC charger is pushed in, so I can't charge.  But, conveniently, MY model is not on THEIR list as being defective, even though it has the SAME problem as those on THE LIST.  So I'm told I have to pay $425 for the repair!!!!!  They insist this is physical damage and not covered.  How can simply plugging the Toshiba charger (that came with the computer) into the jack in the unit cause physical damage unless the part is defective?!  When I asked to speak to someone higher than the case manager I was speaking to, she said she was the highest level (she sounded like she was 12 years old).  I am so frustrated I can't think straight, so I'm rambling here.  But maybe my rant will help someone else make a decision about which brand to buy (or NOT buy)!
__label__2 missing screws windows xp expired
__label__5 Slim and Sexy!  My partner and I took our time to search for the most appropriate notebook for me.  I wanted something to fit into a handbag/notebook bag, that I can carry everyday to work and take on business trips, and I needed enough power, as I usually have too many programs running at once.  I am so impressed and just love the feeling when I take my Macbook out in public places and I see the people around me staring!  It's slim and sexy looking AND it does the job better than anything I ever put my hands on.  In the meantime we have upgraded the RAM to 2 GB - excellent!
__label__4 Netflix and pc on the big screen  It works great. Only the DisplayPort doesn't work with the HDMI dongle some other buyers mentioned. So I returned it and got me the Cable DisplayPort to HDMI for another buyer said that's how it worked. Well it didn't for me even with the DELL displayport/HDMI cable. Yet I finally connected the TV with an audio jack cable and a VGA to VGA cable. Yes I can watch Netflix and HBO on the big screen but quality is not as good as HDMI so I'll have to return it. I'll let you know later how it went with the seller.
__label__1 havent got it yet  haven't got it yet ordered it on july 17 its now 25 no computer yet I ordered it to use why my computer was being fixed I have fixed  computer  back already still no new computer so my 1 star is just because I haven't got it yet
__label__5 Yes! Must have!  Was absolutley pleased with this product. I love it!! It's perfect for just about anything you'd need it for. And the price was good as well. I recommend it!
__label__3 Very nice, but big drawbacks.  I really do like this product, the design is very nice.  I do however had some gripes with it that make me give it a 3.5 rating (If I could).  The Good:  Very well designed.  Runs cool even at high processor usage.  OS X starts up very fast.  The Bad:  While Windows Vista does install as advertised I find the mouse driver provided to be a headache when attempting to right click as it confuses it with two finger scrolling even though i'm not moving my fingers up and down the pad.  The Apple forums have several complaints on this issue to no resolution or updated drivers.  OS X also has its share of problems such as Safari that loves to freeze or crash, especially on certain sites like CNN.com.  In addition I had to rename my entire network to workgroup for me to connect to my Windows shared printer, as changing the workgroup settings on OS X did nothing.  Also I sometimes have issues with shutting down OS X, especially if Safari or another app is crashing.  It does not seem to want to do a force everything to shut down like Linux or Windows is capable of.  Another note is that the product can scratch very easily (as I see with the power adaptor) and thats why I have used an InCase case from day one.  Additional of odd note is that sounds is much louder (at the highest setting) in Windows than on OS X.  The end note is that using Windows is required for me and advertised as working as such and while only 98% of what I want works, the right clicking on lists that love to scroll is a headache.  Additionally I don't find that OS X works 100% and has it issues as well especially with Safari.  I find myself using Opera.

__label__4 Nice Machine  I really like my new MacBook.  It is my first laptop.  Also, this is my first Mac in almost eight years (I've been using Windows since 1999), so the OS is pretty much new to me.  Therefore, I can't really speak to how this compares to iBooks or other G4/G5 machines.  I looked around at PC laptops and compared specs for a while.  I had not seriously considered a Mac because I thought that they were overpriced.  However, this version really is priced competitively.  Those "bargain" PC laptops don't have near the features, and once you start adding upgrades to match the features in this MacBook, the price escalates quickly.  First, the processor in this MacBook is definitely no slouch (and an expensive upgrade for most PC laptops).  The built-in camera is very handy, the 1GB of RAM is adequate for most things, and the built-in wireless and bluetooth are very nice for me.  I was leary to go with the glossy screen because I feared the glare.  I admit that I bought this before I ever went to see one in a store.  However, it really hasn't been a problem for me.  Occasionally I'll see some reflection from bright objects, but not often.  I will say that the viewing angle on the screen is much more limited than I had expected (hence, the four-star rating).  Once I'm situated, it's fine.  However, moving up, down, or side to side dramatically reduces the quality of the picture.  The optimal viewing angle is not one in which the built-in iSight is pointed directly at me, so when I use iChat with my family (they all have Macs), I have to choose between a slightly washed out image of them or having them see only the top of my head.  I like the design quite a bit.  Mine has a small imperfection in the trackpad that causes some irritation as I'm using it.  Also, the edges aren't rounded, so if you type with your arms resting against the bottom of the keypad then you'll feel some discomfort.  Other than that, it really is nice.  The screen is larger than I had expected.  The keys are comfortable to type on and have a good tactile response.  You'll almost surely give up some connectivity (i.e. ports) if you choose this over a PC, but I don't regret my decision one bit.  Overall, it's a nice machine.
__label__3 Good for yonger people looking for something to watch videos on, however some mildly concerning cons.  So here's my honest opinion: Let's start with some cons. So I've had my Mac for about 2 months now and it works pretty well. My 2 main concerns, however, is how hot the laptop gets, and the track pad. I will use my Mac for about 20 minutes, and I cannot keep it on my lap. The bottom of the Mac is so hot that I'll put it on top of a pillow so it doesn't burn whatever is around it. Next, the track pad. So when I go to click on something, it takes about 10 clicks (more or less) to detect what I want to click on. It can get pretty frustrating when i want to simply exit out on a tab or click on a video. Now for the pros: Despite theses negative traits, there are things I can appreciate such as turning it on. On my last laptop, it took a solid 2 minutes to just turn on and boot up to my lock screen. On this Mac, however, it takes me about 15 seconds tops. That is especially helpful when I need to jump on the computer for a few minutes for something small. Another solid pro is that it is very light. I took my Mac on a flight not too long ago and it was very easy to take with me and store away when not being used. A small detail that doesn't really matter, but is a nice touch is the design. I've always liked how macbooks looked, so to finally own one is very exciting. To wrap up: If you are on the younger side (high school or college) I would recommend this for entertainment purposes or homework purposes. However, if you are looking for a laptop for more professional reasons (a job or needed for work) then save up! Because a new fresh out of the apple store is a wiser choice.
__label__2 Works great at first, but after a few years will decline in performance.  I know this is a long review, but it's worth the read.  My MacBook Pro is now running very slow. It's the same as the product that is listed here for sale, I just didn't purchase it from Amazon, but purchased it brand new from the Apple Store when it first came out (see this website for technical specs on my mac: [...] ).  The only thing that is different, is the fact that I have replaced my 4GB ram cards with two 8GB ones about 7 months ago.  It worked perfectly for about 3 months then slowly began to decline again.  It workes ok when browsing the web and doing other simple computer tasks, but if I ever tried to run something real graphics intensive such as HD YouTube videos, Minecraft, or other computer games, it is terrible.  I made the decision to remove all of my files to an external hard drive, and wipe the entire computer and install El Capitan fresh.  It was fast, for seriously only 2 days and now it's worse, usually crashing when I run games, even with graphics on the lowest setting. It has become worse now with the fresh install and I've hardly done anything or re-installed any of my programs.  Even all of my chrome apps don't work and I was notified that they crashed when I booted the computer one time.  I seriously don't understand why my computer sucks... I usually have at least 10GB of free ram (12 right now) and it's still extremely slow.  I'm honestly going to purchase a new non Apple laptop and run Linux because I'm so frustrated.  Even now just typing this message it's acting all slow and won't respond to a right click sometimes and my external mouse lags a ton.  Update: It's been about a week and a half since this past post, and things have gotten worse.  I actually erased the hard drive again completely and installed OSX Lion (the original OS that was on the computer), and it's still running very slow and crashing, and I get the spinning rainbow wheel all the time.  I upgraded to Mountain Lion, and got the same thing.  I am convinced that Apple intentionally slows down their products after 'X' amount of years from purchase just so that you upgrade and purchase another one of their products.  I'm done.  Really disappointed in Apple right now.  They could be the best company on earth, but choose to limit their products just to make money and force you to upgrade.  2 stars because it worked great when it was new, but now is terrible.  I think I got a "bad apple" on this one (pun intended).  RIP Steve Jobs, you were great.  Seriously, before you passed, the products were amazing.  I also was not able to post this review on the official Apple Discussions page, as it would not let me.
