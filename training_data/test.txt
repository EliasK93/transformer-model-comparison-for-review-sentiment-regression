__label__5 AMAZINGLY EASY AND FAST! A++++++++  I HAD ALWAYS WANTED TO MAKE "THE SWITCH" BUT NEVER HAD THE GUTS.  WHEN LEOPARD CAME OUT, I BEGAN TO READ ALL THE REVIEWS AND WATCH THE TUTORIALS.  AFTER A FEW MONTHS I WAS CONFIDENT TO MAKE THE JUMP. I WENT TO APPLE TO MAKE THE PURCHASE FIRST AND SAID IT WOULD NOT SHIP FOR A FEW DAYS BUT I WAS READY SO I WENT TO AMAZON AND SAW "ORDER IN THE NEXT 47 MINUTES AND GET IT TOMORROW"  SO I DID THAT.  AND THE NO SALES TAX WAS AMAZING.  THE NEXT MORNING IT ARRIVED.  I PROMPTLY OPENED THE BOX AND PLUGGED IT IN TO CHARGE AND BEGIN TO "PLAY".  I THOUGHT THE 1GB OF RAM WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH BUT I HAD 8 PROGRAMS RUNNING THAT NIGHT WITH ZERO LAG.  I DID UPGRADE TO A 2GB RAM 1 DIMM CARD THOUGH AND ITS PERFECT!!  ALL OF THE MAC PROGRAMS WORK GREAT.  ONE MAC PROGRAM IS NOT WORKING PROPERLAY AND THAT IS MY BLACKBERRY SYNC TOOL BUT IT IS PROBABLY SOMETHING WITH VERIZON.  THE SPEED IS FASTER THAN BOTH OF MY XP LAPTOPS. AND IT SURFS AND DOWNLOADS FASTER THAN BOTH OF THEM.  THE APPLE REMOTE WORKS GREAT EVEN ACCROSS THE ROOM. AND THE .MAC FEATURE HAS WORKED FLAWLESSLY.  I HAVE A BLUETOOTH MOUSE WHICH CONNECTED SO MUCH EASIER THAN ON A PC.  THE SPEAKERS ARE LOUD BUT NOT QUITE LOUD ENOUGH.  THE ONLY THING THAT IS A LITTLE BELOW PAR IS BATTERY LIFE.  I GET ROUGHLY 3-3.5 HOURS OF BATTERY LIFE.  IT DROPS TO 2.5-3 WHEN I AM LISTENING TO MUSIC AND SURFING THE WEB.  I NOW TELL EVERYONE TO MAKE THE SWITCH! I HAVEN'T LOOKED BACK YET!
__label__5 Great business laptop  I am a consultant who is replacing a 3 year old PowerBook G4 867 MHz. Since I don't need the advanced graphics of the MacBook Pro, I got the 2.0 GHz MacBook. It didn't feel that fast with the stock 512 MB RAM, but has performed beautifully since I upgraded it to 2 GB RAM. Universal applications (Mail, Safari, DayLite, OmniGraffle) all snap open and run quickly. Non-Universal applications (MS Office, QuickBooks) also launch quickly and have run very well. Using a FireWire cable to transfer over from my old PowerBook was pure simplicity, and even the search terms I use in Safari copied over (I was stunned).  The only complaints I have (and they are minor) is (1) the keyboard has taken some getting used to, and (2) Front Row performs surprisingly sluggishly. On the second point, since all other applications have performed near-flawlessly, I will assume Apple still has some work to do on Front Row.  From a business standpoint, using Office and QuickBooks on the Mac, and having the ability to load Parallels to run Windows if I encounter an application not native for the Mac), means I can operate in a largely Windows world without having to worry about viruses, malware, etc. (at least, for now).
__label__2 Just got this laptop it's used i know but my goodness it's slow...just using this for school work no roaming the net.
__label__4 Brummo  I've never owned a laptop before so this is premissed by that.  The power is great and it is quick to process what games I have. Setting up to a wifi has been a bit challenging but will work it out.  A couple of movies didn't play in the in drive and had to play them on the regular tv, think they were old and scratched up a bit.  Finger prints are a livable issue given the performance and price.
__label__3 Why a Notebook?  I thought Samsung was coming out with a touch-pad, instead of another laptop. We already have laptops and Google Apps, so I'm not running out to get one. When they finally get a touch-pad out, I hope it works with the Samsung Smart Media Center for their TV's and Blu-Ray players. Just a thought Samsung.
__label__4 Very good desktop replacement system  I decided to purchase a new laptop after my old laptop was taken over by the family for a variety of tasks. I was mostly happy with the system I had, a nice HP Pavilion system with a decent feature set, but considering that it is 2-3 years old and does not run everything I want to run anymore I wanted to make my upgrade to a new system worthwhile. In researching I found this particular system and I pounced on it, as I found it at a steal of a price. It is not perfect, but there is an awful lot in this notebook.  My very first notebook was a Sony Vaio, so I imagined that this would be familiar territory. I was greatly mistaken, as things have changed dramatically since then, mostly for the better.  First off, this is a fast system with lots of expansion room. This is very important to me because I do a little bit of everything - I do some gaming, I write software, I write short stories, I hang out online. I am not considered a power user in that regard so an AlienWare ultra-high-powered expensive gaming rig is not really what I need, but I don't need an entry-level system that is good for little more than checking email either. My needs are for a well-rounded machine that can do most things well. This notebook fits that need.  I am especially impressed with the bright, large screen. I do occasionally toss a movie DVD into the system and treat myself to a private showing of whatever movie I have chosen, and all of that screen real estate makes for an enjoyable experience.  As for DVDs... With Blu-ray built into this system, watching new media movies is not a concern. That's a very nice plus.  I like the fact that this system has two individual hard drives instead of one large one, as I want to create a dual-boot system and not wipe out the whole thing. I was unaware of this when I purchased the system, thinking I had a unified drive, though that was an oversight - the labeling and documentation are clear.  The system comes with 3 GB RAM, expandable to 4. Up to this point things seem to be comfortable in that amount of room.  My first task was to strip off the trial software I don't want or need, which includes MS Office 2007, Webroot SpySweeper and Norton 360. Some people will appreciate these applications but for me they are in the way and clutter the hard drive with unneeded stuff. If these applications were full-release apps with more than 30-90 days of use, I likely would keep them all but in my case I already have licensed software to use that meet the same needs.  The documentation states that there is a firewire port, a VGA port and an S-Video port, and it took searching the web for a manual with technical diagrams to reveal that these are hidden on the right side, under a cover. Nothing that came with the system says where to find those ports, and the cover that conceals these ports blends in well enough to truly hide them - I did not find them without help.  Even more concerning to me is the number and placement of the USB ports. There is one on the back, and two on the right side close to the front edge. I work with an external mouse but I use the built-in keyboard, and I am right-handed. So, if I plug anything at all into those two front edge USB ports, the cords interfere with my mouse use. The solution, then, is to plug a 4-port hub in the back and then plug everything in there.  The built-in speakers are all right, though nothing special. If you want better speakers plug them in and all is well. That said, the built-ins are quite acceptable for most use. You would not want to use them for listening to symphony music, of course, but they're just fine for gaming and general music.  I am very pleased with the graphics. My litmus test for gaming is Neverwinter Nights 1 & 2, and both of these play quite smoothly. I have not loaded up Unreal Tournament 3 yet - that's next - but it should have no difficulty at all with that game.  I did run into one problem that required a call to Sony technical support. Because Sony does not include recovery media with their systems, it is up to the owner to create them and Sony makes it easy with included utilities. There are two options for creating the media - 1 dual-layer DVD or 2 single-layer DVDs. I chose the single dual-layer and after an hour of writing and grinding, the DVD ejected and the system said the creation failed. Assuming it was the target medium, I tried again with the same result. I called Sony thinking I needed to request the recovery DVDs and the technician told me that the single-layer DVD creation would work but that a glitch with this specific model prevents the dual-layer media creation from working. When I used two single-layer DVDs, everything created without a hitch.  This brings up a good point. Some places provide horrible service with operators that no one can understand. I got through in a reasonable amount of time (it was 5am but I still had a brief wait) and I got a very pleasant fellow who was very easy to understand (he did have and accent, though I could not place it) and was very helpful.  This is my desktop replacement system. It does everything I need it to do, it works well and it has a good feature set. It is certainly not perfect, but even at full price it is a good deal for what you get. It is NOT a top-of-the-line gaming rig but it's not marketed as such. If you want a good well-rounded machine, give this one some consideration.
__label__5 Nice  Very nice for money! Hubby uses for work. Will order again in future. Everything works great, look great, very happy!
__label__5 My first Mac experience  Mac! M Loving it!!!!  Boy, this is a super product...One of the lovliest things I have ever used in my life...I was a PC user till I bought this mac..And this is the first time ever that I am using a macintosh computer and I am really happy that I made the right choice. The decision to buy a macbook was made all of a sudden and I do not regret making that decision. From the moment I switched it on for the first time and till this moment, I have been amazed every single day with the ever appealing(& pleasing to eye) features of this OS. It is just so beautiful. I am still trying to learn the Mac OS cos' it's been less than a month since I bought this beauty. The only worry I am having is that some of the other gadgets(Nokia phone & Creative Zen Vision M) that I have do not have compatible software for Mac yet :-(  I am waiting for that day to arrive when these companies release mac compatible S/W. That day, this laptop would have exceeded my expectations by a very large margin...  Here are some of my favourite features in the Macbook:  1. Wow! Beautiful! Gorgeous!  2. The screen resolution is unbelievable! Some of my pictures come to life when I see them through this wonder..  3. The keyboard is intelligently laid out and adds more beauty to the macbook (I like this keyboard better than the one in Pro)  4. The built in camera and microphone are of excellent quality.  5. The two finger feature when using the Trackpad really makes life easy  6. Remote control feature..I use it a lot..Actually I would like to see a few more features added to the Remote in future..  7. Navigation on the dock and files is super fast and slick  I can keep going on and on...cos there are so many things that I like about this..In fact, I have fallen in love with my MacBook ;-)  Things that I would have liked:  1. Few more gigs of hard drive space  2. A good stereo headset supplied in the box, considering the fact that this is a portable/personal product  3. An animated tutorial preloaded in the MacBook to help train switchers get used to the Mac OS interface and basics. I see a lot of stuff on the web, but they are too wordy and time-consuming to read and understand.  4. A more rigid connection between the base and the screen of the laptop(I feel like, I might accidentally break or hurt this link)  Lokesh
__label__5 Excellent!!!!  FAST SHIPPING, LOVE IT
__label__2 Becareful when you do not like this product  I found this deal at [...] Headlinedeals.com and ordered the product on Dec 9th as a gift for my wife. It was delivered a few days later. Unfortunately my wife didn't like the product when it was fully revealed out of the package. It is a bit bulky in a 12.1" size. The LCD with a very wide trim edge compare to my 13.1" PIII6000.  I wanted to return it to Amazon, but only to find it is a product from Tech Depot and I can not return it to Home depot either!  I call Tech Depot for RMA number, only to find the following message from them a few more days later:  We have received your request to return the following product:  Avertec AV 3250H1 Athlon XP-M 12.1 TFT  Please be aware that your request appears to be out of policy for one or more reasons. (Only new, factory sealed product is returnable)  For this reason, the request was submitted to management for an exception approval.  Unfortunately, they were unsuccessful in their attempt.  Reason: RD - Refer Direct. Please Contact Manufacturer-which means that vendor name request that all return be handle through them. Please call 408 294-4336  I will call that number later. Anyway, as a longtime customer at Amazon.com, I wished that Amzon.com had not sell this product on the website with hidden policis.  I would rather spend more money at store at Bestbuy or Circuit City because they have better policy regarding return or refund.
__label__1 Netbook-notbook  We were hoping to make this work, but the speed, capabilities, and ease of use don't make it worth it.  The speed is slow, and opening pages, or having more that one page open makes it even slower.  Not the same as a laptopnot having a CD-rom drive/DVD player is a big loss.
__label__4 Good Deal  Bought as a gift for my father.  He's an intermdiate/advanced level user, so figured he'd give this a good run.  The machine is very lightweight and really delivers.  Very nice display with reasonable battery life. Get another GB of RAM if you can - the weakness with this machine is probably the OS's steep RAM needs - oink, oink!  Liked the Toshiba laptops in 90's, but they sort of dropped in quality (IMO), so I stayed away from them.  This isn't too bad and a real steal for the $$.
__label__5 Sony Vaio  laptop  Hi Sony Vaio Laptop is sleek and easy to use.. Pros: 2 GB RAM and 200 GB harddisk..more than I need Cons: Processor speed is less Laptop is worth for the price I paid..
__label__1 ACER support is almost non-existent  I purchased this laptop on the 13th of last December, as a Christmas gift for my 11 year old daughter.  It ran about an hour before it randomly started freezing and rebooting. I spent a week trying to "fix it", BIOS updates, Windows 7 upgrade, patches, etc.  Trying to get "support" from Acer is a nightmare.  But I did send it back for "repair", by the way if you want to keep the original box don't use it for shipping.  After their repair (replacing its memory) it came back and still rebooted and/or froze ... even while quietly sitting at the prom.  I blame myself for purchasing the Acer, I took a risk that I'd get a working system ... and I lost.  As a computer engineer with 20+ years of experience I find it amazing that this company is still doing business ... it has to have the worst support known to man.  After the failed repair I got a phone number from Google and spoke to a live human to ask for a replacement. I was told that it is Acer's policy to NOT replace merchandise for any reason.  [...]  Really?  Update (Jun 2010)  After sending it back (again), and it's continuing erratic behavior, it was too much.  It was still acting up, and my 12 year old daughter "accidentally" dropped it ... now the screen is cracked.  Can't say it was much of a loss... well except for the money.
__label__5 Great Little Web Surfer  This does everything I wanted it to! I wanted something small I could carry with me and travel for internet purposes and this is perfect! I use it everyday and everything works like a charm! I have only used windows before this Netbook but now that I see how this operating systems works I am not sure why all computer do not use it.  Boots up in seconds and I have never had any problems getting on-line with it. This is a very simple system to use. Everyone who see's it loves it and wants to get one as well.  Perfect travel size, Easy to use, Nice internet connection! Need I say more??  Down falls are: Does not have a lot of ram so to watch a downloaded movie is not smooth and it is very small so you will not get that 15" in screen for viewing, but again I wanted small so works great for me.  Highly Recommended!!
__label__3 Did not include the mouse as indicated on the webpage. Did not disclose that no sound set up for internal output.
__label__3 ASUS Eee PC  Overall the ASUS netbook has been a nice computer. However, the couple of complaints I have are with the battery pack. For example, the adapter that plugs into the laptop looks very frail as though it can/will break easily. Another issue with the batter pack is that the battery blue light stays on even if I disconnect the computer from the battery and leave the battery plugged into the wall outlet. So I must always remember to disconnect the battery pack from the computer and the wall.
__label__3 Great machine except fr the keyboard  At first, I really liked this Acer.  Great display, Win 7 runs well, everything loads quickly, startup is fast.  The keyboard felt a little flimsy, but I figured it was me.  Yet, instead of my typing improving as I got used to it (I'm a pretty good typist) more and more errors appeared: many missed letters, r letters coming in double, just like another user reported.  In less than three weeks of use, the key for Q became stuck, and i had to flip up the flimsy little cover to get at the actual mechanism; eventually that hinged cover came off.  I spent a lot of time setting this macchine up, and to think that I will have to get rid of anything personal, like quickbooks and tax info so that I can get it fixed -- well, let's just say I'm NOT happy!!  Never mind lost productivity because I'll have to go back to my old, slow-as-molasses XP laptop.  I gave it three stars because everything else is great.
__label__2 Great little computer that had display go bad within a week.  I bought this amazing little computer for WiFi Internet use and for storing and playing back videos downloaded through the Amazon.com Unbox software.  The display was great, and it played videos flawlessly; to me a miracle at the price point.  Here I had everything my laptop has only without the DVD drive.  The problem is that the display developed a blue line down the middle that was there all the time.  I researched and found that display problems seem to happen a lot with the Aspire One series of machines.  Since I was within the return window, I deinstalled everything, wiped the data clean, and returned it.  That was a lot of work for very little use.  I'm thankful for the return policy, but not for all the wasted time commissioning and decommissioning this machine.  It takes time to do that correctly.  I think Acer should have tested the display more before putting the machine into production.  That said, I'm very open to buying a future version of this little miracle computer.
__label__4 I was nervous about Vista, not anymore... I like this PC  I'm reviewing A215-S7437 (200GB HD). I noticed the review By William Balsam "Ursus" was for a different model with a smaller HD (160) A good review though.  First of all, as was mentioned by A. B. Davis "brdavis", in an above review. There are some initial issues that need to be addressed. I first powered the unit up I noticed a lot of "crap-ware" (if you Google "cnet crapware" the top hit is a link to a helpful video to rid your PC of crap-ware) this is relatively easy to remove, remember without crap-ware, you pay more for your PC.  As mentioned also above in A. B. Davis's review (I found most helpful, BTW) there is some (he called "artifacts, one pixel deep") weird dimmed lines segmented at the very top of the display about 1" long each, 1mm wide, and about 5 or six of them all across the top of the display, right up at the very upper edge, the furthest right one being brighter than the rest. I knew this was loaded by some program, not sure which one either I went to run>msconfig, (to bring up the run box in Vista hold the start button and press R key). Go to select startup tab, in Windows Vista, all of the Windows's essentials are loaded through "Windows Services" - this means that most of the startup item you see in Vista are completely optional. (For help in identifying items go to [...]) Anyway, that solved that problem, no more lines at the top of the display.  The other problem was loading Roxio 7. I kept getting errors and I kept trying to force feed the install, the battle ensued, I eventually won... ?? I don't know how, I don't know why, I don't really care, it works. There is a DVD burner program on this PC already, I just like Roxio. Other than these little glitches, I like this PC, its sleek looking, sturdy, has all I need, has plenty of speed. The display is quite bright and the resolution much better than my old Gateway MX6025, (the only other laptop I've owned before). Vista is pretty cool, I was skeptical at first, but so far, I like the new platform. It's not so bad. I'll get used to it, so will you.  Looked at a lot of notebook/laptop PC's (would have rather got a Mac, not that rich though) this was the best for the price. It met my needs, actually exceeded them.
__label__1 hate it, terrible customer service, and I'm a Windows expert  I paid about $1500 for this piece of junk, and hate it.  The newest problem is that the microphone doesn't work, and the audio only works at about half the level of the other PCs that I have.  I called Toshiba support about the microphone problem, and their support people from India made me reboot and do other things to waste my time, then said they'd call back, which they haven't done in 6 days now.  Its also full of bloatware (software to try to get you to buy more of their stuff, like their unproven online backup), all of which slows down the machine, or interferes with your standard work.  Don't make the same mistake I did.
__label__4 Toshiba T2330 Laptop  This notebook is cheap and powerful with a T2330 processor. It has a 160 GB hard drive and 2 GB RAM which is remarkable for the price I paid. Toshiba machines have always been heavy and bulky and this one is no exception. Previously I had a 17 inch 12 pound mammoth but its technology was incomparable at the time. Also, only XP Home Edition was included. Vista is better as I detest games. I really like this inexpensive notebook.
__label__3 Product description is incorrect  The notebook does not support Hyper Threading (as given in many sites). I checked the Intel site for this processor and found that it does (or so I thought). Just to confirm, I downloaded Intel Processor Id utility and it reported that the processor does not support HT.    As is the case with most of the branded notebooks, the amount of tweaking that you can do on the system is highly limited. For example, you cannot even change any BIOS settings (except date time/parallel port info and set passwords). None of the advanced chipset features are available. And the BIOS is phoenix bios, which is not supported by most of the BIOS tweak tools that you can run from windows.    The cooling fan does make a lot of noise at times, but I have come to get used to that and unfortunately, you cannot control the fan speed through the power management tool (unlike the case in some other models).    The display is really good with high resolution. I am not into much gaming and all, so the 4X AGP does not make much difference to me.    A couple of things Sony could have improved upon was to put a 333 MHz memory instead of a 266 MHz one and provide a more versatile card reader (the card reader slot supports only Memory Stick Media. So if you want to connect your CF or SD card, you need an external reader.    But having said this much, I am happy with the system and it has not given me any problems so far.
__label__1 MacBook Woes  I purchased my MacBook almost three months ago based on the reviews. My mistake. I admit that I did expect to find the change from Windows to Leopard (Mac OS X 10.5.4) a challenge. What I did NOT expect was that the support personnel at Apple would be so poorly trained that their help was almost useless. The standard solution after 2-3 hours on the phone was to reinstall the operating system. Big mistake. I downloaded Adobe, and it would not work properly on this laptop. I could no longer open simple pdf files. So, I called Apple support. Two hours later I was told to archive and reinstall the operating system. After doing that I still couldn't view pdf files, but finally used spotlight to find that there was still a small adobe file that needed to be deleted. That whole problem should have been a 5 minute phone call.  Unfortunately now  the printer would not work. Two more hours on the phone, and the "support tech" told me to remove the printer and then add it back. Bingo, the printer now worked. But again, more wasted hours. The next day I tried to access the Itunes store. Nope, couldn't do that either anymore. Three more hours on the phone, and I was told that it isn't possible to access the Itunes store from a managed account. Interesting that I have been doing just that for the past three months. Bottom line, don't expect decent support from Apple. If you buy a Macbook, you are really on your own. If you are familiar with Apple computers or have superior technical skills, you should do OK. But if you are coming over from Windows, you will only find frustration and misery. I will attempt to force Apple to take this thing back, and give me a refund. If that fails, I will try to find someone who still thinks that Apple is the greatest thing since sliced bread, and sell this MacBook to them!!!
__label__2 Outdated  Died pretty quick.  Very outdated.
__label__5 Laptop is fine, works ok, Im so happy with this product.
__label__3 Great hardware, not so great software  The great part...hardware-wise, this laptop is top of the line.  Fast Core 2 Duo, 2GB ram, large HDD, 8400M GS, etc.  It has a BEAUTIFUL screen and is insanely light-weight.  Some people do not like the feel of the casing or the keyboard, saying it feels plasticy or cheap, but honestly, I think it feels solid and durable.  The keyboard is the perfect size in my opinion and the casing feels like high quality.  Now comes the not so great part.  Vista! I have never used Vista before but thought that since I'm fairly good with XP, Vista shouldn't be too hard to learn.  Like any new OS you play with, there will be some time spent learning where new features are and how to change this or that.  I'm well aware of that.  Never once did I think this would be an instantaneous transition from XP to Vista.  And actually, it wasn't so much the transition that aggravated me as it was the bugginess of Vista.  I can't say for sure if it is Vista, Sony's software, or a mix, but I had to spend a good chunk of time spread over a week just to get this OS running somewhat stable.  Even at this point, I'm not 100% sure all the kinks are worked out.  I am sure when SP1 comes out for Vista, it will help out tremendously.  So yeah, I'm not sure how to rate this item since on one hand, I love the  design/look and the hardware packed in.  On the other hand, there are definitely some software issues such as Vista and all the bloat-ware installed.  If you're willing to put forth the effort to do any kind of software cleaning, then by the end, you will have one spectacularly running machine.  I got this for a very reasonable price as well from Amazon, so that is another plus to this.  However, if I had bought this a lot earlier when it was $2000+, I would be extremely mad to have to go through so much trouble just to get the laptop to run properly.
__label__1 Be Careful with Your Purchase.  I purchased a Lenovo Y510 2 months ago. It works fine, is very responsive, with good memory, RAM, etc. To my shock, I recently found out that Lenovo does not make a Docking Station for the computer! In fact, they have no idea if they ever will. I spoke to their representatives for nearly an hour and got nowhere, other than stalling. When referred to the Complaint Dept. I got a recording. One would think that a professional (?) mfg. firm would provide ancillary support items!!!!
__label__5 NO MORE BLACK SCREEN OF DEATH  I bought a 215 series laptop from Office Depot a week ago and got the Black Screen of Death an hour into using it. I searching the net I too found the minimum processor fix and haven't had a problem since.
__label__4 good netbook  IT IS A PRETTY GOOD DEAL ON THIS NETBOOK . I GOT THE ONE WITH LINUX . TO ME IT IS FAST ON HOOKING UP TO THE INTERNET. ONLY DOWNFALL IS THE BATTERY. GOT TO TELL YOU WHEN WE GOT OURS MY GIRLS LIKED IT SO MUCH I HAD TO BUY 2 MORE FOR MY GIRLS. SO I GOT 3 NOW. THIS IS BETTER THAN MY GIRLS COMPAQ & FASTER.
__label__2 You Can Get a Better PC For Your $$  The pc condition was just fair. I wouldn't say it's at decent condition. I though I could get a good deal by buying old PC but I was wrong. I got this pc for $201 (after tax and shipping). A week after receiving this product. I notice ads and retail stores having NEW pc with Windows 8 for just $270 to $290. If you are like me trying to buy a decent pc and save $ then just put out a little more and buy a much better pc than these used ones, which looks very used, dirty, and slow.
__label__5 Awesome!!  Small, ultra portable, awesome screen. Hook it to your belt and go. Like everybody else says, the extended battery is a must. I use mine with Sprint's wireless usb card, just like broadband at home.
__label__5 Great Laptop  Great Laptop.  Works better than any windows based Laptop I have had, and it has enough memory to run Windows Boot Camp too!
__label__3 As a Software Developer's Laptop: Power - Win! Heat - Fail! Battery - Fail!  As a Software Developer I was looking for something that was powerful and affordable. I need to be able to fire up a proper dev environment anywhere, without worrying about the pitfalls of laptops one usually gets at this price (they're really underpowered).  This laptop delivers on power. I can run multiple instances of Visual Studio 2010 with Sql Server running full steam, music in the background, office apps all over the place and this thing does not even blink. Incredible stuff.  However, it overheats bad. Real bad. If you're running those eight cores anywhere near their full potential then you are going to know all about it. If it's on your lap, you will want to take it off your lap with 10 minutes or so. If your left hand is near the exhaust where the heat is dispelled, you will want to move it quick-sticks.  Yes, this laptop heats up fast when you put it to good use, and this is unpleasant. Furthermore, when running full steam you don't expect it to go more 90 minutes or so. The battery life is pathetic. So much so that after only 2 weeks of using this pup, my Asus is now for sale.
__label__5 Excellent buy  I love my little asus.  While it will probably never manage to be a workhorse, that's not why I bought it.  It's fabulous for general net surfing and basic office doc uses, works great out of the box and is incredibly portable.  The speakers sound good.  I do wish that getting rid of unwanted/unecessary programs was easier, but they aren't really in the way, especially since adding external memory is so easy and doesn't really cause much slow down.  It's also so *cute*.  Practically everyone who sees it stops to comment on it.  Best computer money I've spent since I bought my original desktop system.
__label__4 IBM THINKPAD T43  1.86GHz 512MG 40GB LAPTOP (REFURBISHED)  I REALLY LIKE THIS COMPUTER. VERY INEXPENSIVE AND DOES AS WELL AS MORE EXPENSIVE COMPUTERS. I HAVE APPLE iMAC COMPUTER AND EVER SINCE I RECEIVED THE IBM THINKPAD 14 INCH NOTEBOOK COMPUTER I USE THIS COMPUTER MORE THAN MY 20 INCH APPLE COMPUTER. IT IS VERY EASY TO USE. I THINK IT WORKS FASTER THAN MY APPLE COMPUTER. THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE IS I CANNOT GET TO WORK WIRELESS,MAYBE IT IS ME. I WOULD SAY THIS COMPUTER IS A VERY GOOD BUY!!
__label__3 Not bad  This is my first and possibly last review. The product overall is built nicely and is "completely aluminum" compared to other products advertised as such (Samsung series 7). I will not discuss the positive aspects of the machine but instead focus on its weaknesses.  =The product I received has some minor aesthetic blemishes. The sides of the laptop are somewhat chipped as well hardly visible scuff-marks possibly a sign of "neglectful handling". Could be numerous variables shipping etc. =The aligning of the lid is off, again minor and hardly noticeable. =The rubber support tabs on the bottom are loose. =Sharp palm rest =Slow hard drive (5400 rpm) installing an ssd can dramatically enhance users experience =Minor flexing on the top of the lid; have not checked the keyboard
__label__1 Looks very nice, but not working.  This looks very nice, but my son hasn't been able to use it because the flash drive is out of date or no good??? Not happy.
__label__5 2g Green Surf  I just recieved my asus eee 2g surf pc today, two days after ordering! I placed my order on the 15th around midnight and it still came today! I was very excited. I met a few problems trying to enable full desktop (im not too keen with linux, but i eventually figured it out by visiting some forums) but other that everything is fabulous! I plan on using the eee for taking notes in classes (im a college student) and for browsing around campus ... if the eee had some kind of day planner installed it would be perfect!
__label__2 keyboard issues  I previously owned an ASUS laptop that I was very happy with. Although the graphics are great on this one, I am disappointed with both the mouse and the keyboard. They are very jumpy and touchy. My friend owns the same laptop and has similar issues. Also ASUS is very, very difficult to work with. Lousy customer support.
__label__1 Very frustrating  I was working with the gentleman that sold me this computer because it would not turn on after about 3-6 months of owning it. Franz was so incredibly helpful and bent over backwards just to get this computer up and running again! It was working for about 2 months from that point and is now no longer turning on again. I have tried contacting Franz twice now and have no gotten a response. After spending about $700 on a used computer this has become SO frustrating. Because now I can not even sell this computer with all my information on the hard drive.
__label__3 It's not perfect...but it's still a Mac  If I had it to do again, I might have gone a different route. I mean, I know this is a refurb, but I can't help being disappointed with the screen defects (brownish spots splashed across the middle of the display). If I didn't need this immediately for my classes (my old laptop died partway through the semester) and they didn't charge a fairly substantial restocking fee, I might have returned this. However, it IS still a Mac and, with a bit of a RAM upgrade, quite capable of handling the new OS X (which, in my opinion, is pretty sweet). Knowing what I know now, I would have spent a little more and gotten something a little newer. It's ok for an older machine...just be aware that it probably will have some irritating defects here and there.
__label__3 Expect what you pay for.  It worked fine for like a couple weeks the started freezing from time to time ik not sure how to fiz that but im not buying apple products online anymore.
__label__4 Just what I wanted  I bought the Asus eee laptop just before going to China for two weeks. I was hoping I could access email and upload photos during our trip but I didn't want to lug a full-size laptop.  It worked perfectly!  This is the perfect travel personal laptop (I wouldn't try to substitute this for a work laptop).  With all the loaded software, we didn't have to do anything except turn it on.  It easily found any wireless networks and connected to them flawlessly.  I was able to upload pictures to our web account and send out emails to friends so they could see the pictures while we were still in China.  I didn't give it 5 stars because of two issues. The first is the small keyboard. It is cramped and often I would hit the wrong key. The "B" key also stuck a bit.  OTOH, my children think the keyboard fits them perfectly. The second issue is that ironically at home the laptop will not always connect to our home wireless network automatically - I have to type in the WEP key.  This started happening when I updated the BIOS. Previously, the computer connected without any problems.
__label__3 Good for the time  I've now had that Lenovo G550 laptop for little over 3 years. I bought it directly from the Lenovo website. I used it only for schooling and as such some features I didn't fully explore (such as the graphics card) Here's what I've found.  THE GOOD:  -Cheap -Windows 7 -User friendly -not a lot of bloatware -Good battery -veri-face software is very secure -multiple usb ports -disc drive -10keys -up to date when first purchased -webcam with easy to use technology -volume control location/mechanics -status light location -manual restart/on and off buttons for certain functions in case keyboard shortcuts failed -durable  NEUTRAL:  -keyboard -location of FN key -screen size -location of power cord/usb ports -screen resolution  THE BAD:  -Heavy/bulky -gets hot quickly -mouse pad often gets in the way of typing due to location -started to slow down after 2.5 yrs -tech support is horrid - phone number on website hard to find as you have to know which category your laptop falls under, I also found the actual support to be lacking and it's outsourced, so good luck understanding them! -number lock turns off after restart/power down -windows 7 showed up as 'non-genuine' in 2nd yr, I bought package with full windows 7 and when I called to get it fixed, they wanted an additional $70 to fix it even though I bought it upon purchase and I had a 3yr warranty -dead pixel 1yr in -easily scratches and shows fingerprints -motherboard fried in under a year-they sent out tech to my home to replace said motherboard, and he arrived almost a week and a half later then I was told -had a default setting of where it would automatically create a backup file...in the hard drive. figured that out 3rd week in when it said I was running out of room...  Considering I used it only for school, it met up to my expectations. Would I buy from Lenovo again? No. The issues I did have with it where enough to scare me off from the product. It now acts slow and clunky, almost as if it contains a massive amount of info, which is doesn't. I'm also starting to have issues with the wifi detector in the computer, and have no desire to deal with that hassle.  I recommend this laptop for a first time user, as it is good as a starter laptop or for someone who doesn't need it to do much or last long. My issues may have been unique, but it doesn't change the fact that I had to contact tech support 2-3 times, and every time it was hassle. At one point I used their chat tech support, I was told to call in and they gave me the phone number to the wrong tech line, I was on the phone to that techy for 2hrs before he realized he what was going on and I was then transferred to wait again and talk again to another tech...no, not worth it.  I give it 3 stars, it worked while I had it and some features where nice, but it kept getting worse the older it got.
__label__1 DONT BUY  Damaged and nonworking computer. NOT AT ALL HAPPY WITH THE VENDER
__label__2 Hard to believe  Very disappointed with the configuration of the laptop that I got. On the site configuration says Windows 7 with 2.1GHz Intel Core 2 Duo but it came with Win Xp and processor Pentium Dual-Core. The body is all cheap plastic.
__label__2 UGH!  I bought this computer in August for college..initially, I loved it.  The appearance is perfect; however, the quality is poor.  Approximately two months after purchasing, my screen would randomly turn black and my computer wouldn't turn back on.  After speaking with customer service several times, we finally fixed this problem.  Recently, I took my laptop back to the Geek Squad at Best Buy to tell them about the terribly loud noises that it makes.  They kept my laptop for a week, then said that they heard the "jet engine sound" it was making, but that it was normal.  I'm sorry, but if my roommate can hear my computer roaring from across the room then it shouldn't be normal.  The noises are incredibly annoying and I find it hard to concentrate on what I'm doing...also, I have to restart often.  I definitely would not recommend this computer.  I have had it for 7 months, and have had problems for the past 5.
__label__5 More than a great little gadget  After a little over 24 hours of using this item, I have to say this little gadget is much more than just a fun must-have.  Set-up was quick and easy.  It connected instantly to our corporate network without any input by me.  With our Windows-based units, it normally takes about 10-15 minutes to get everything up and running.  At home, I had it connected to my home network in about 10 minutes, most of that time was spent getting my other computer configured.  I do have a few complaints though and they are minor.  One, it seems to be a little picky about how it connects to the wireless network.  I had to shut it down and restart it several times before it would connect.  After it connected once though, it had no problems.  Two, the windows (tabs) at times are not visible completely - I maximized a window a couple of times and could not scroll to all of the edges and actually had to close out the window (tab).  Setting up my mail was a chore because all of the options at the bottom were not visible, so I just had to hit enter on the keyboard and hope the right button was highlighted.  All-in-all this is a great product.  Aside from the screen size, it is every bit as functional as my work laptop.  Open Office works great with only minor formatting issues.  The keyboard is an acceptable size.  I have the 4G Surf model, which at the time I ordered it Asus only listed one model on their website and that was the 4G model.  I thought I was getting the webcam and the higher capacity battery.  The 4G Surf model does not have those items, but I can purchase them separately.  I successfully downloaded the beta version of Skype for Linux, which includes video conferencing capabilities.  I have not tried it yet, but it looks like it should work.  If you visit some websites, it will tell you that Skype for Linux will have that capability in 2008 - it is available now.  I like this computer for what it is - a lightweight travel companion that I can take anywhere and use anywhere.  For the price I paid, you cannot get a quality laptop that runs this fast and is this practical.  The 900mhz processor and 512mb RAM runs faster than our 1.6ghz Windows-based desktops.  Update: After a little research I learned that you can hold down Alt and left-click anywhere on the window to move it around.  Also, wireless works a lot better now - I have no problems connecting anywhere I go.  The problems I had before must have been a fluke.  The other day I wanted to find certain store, so I parked in front of a restaurant with Wi-Fi and connected to the internet to find where I wanted to go.  What a great deal!
__label__4 Not a bad laptop for general personal use if you install a faster hard drive and install the maximum RAM.  Not bad for an older computer if you max out the memory and use Windows 7.  The hard drives are not particularly speedy but can easily be swapped out for something much faster, which helps with performance.
