The best portable out there (for both Windows or Mac OS X!)  I bought this machine a little over a month ago, it replaced my Powerbook G3 1.5 Ghz.  From the moment I have started using it, I have been quite impressed on how well it performs.  Keep in mind that you MUST add RAM to it, the 512 MB that it comes with are nothing.  With that much memory, working with Rosetta apps (binaries that were build for PPC) will really slow down your system.  I upgraded to 1.5 GB and this thing FLIES.  For example, when using handbrake to create an mp4 file from a movie DVD, it took my old Powerbook around 4 hours.  The MBP can do it in 45 minutes which totally blows me away.  Keep in mind that at the time of this writing, there are many apps out there (Adobe Photoshop, Dreamweaver) that will not run at full native speed.  This does not mean they are unbearable to work with, they are just not running as fast as they could.  I use Photoshop on weekly basis for designing web pages.  Its speed is like that of using Photoshop on my iMac G5 - so trust me, its not bad at all.  As I have mentioned before, cram it with RAM and things will work great.  Performance-wise it is top notch.  With the recent release of Boot Camp, you can now easily run Windows on a separate partition.  This should really be tempting to some Windows users out there that want to try OS X but are scared of not liking it and then being stuck with a machine they won't use.  If you are Windows user, do yourself a favor and get this laptop.  In case you hate OS X, just boot under Windows and you will be right at home.  Recent benchmarks that I have read of comparable Acer systems leave the MPB as a clear contender even when running Windows XP.  The backlit keyboard, iSight, the remote control are just extras that put icing on the cake.  I have never been so happy with a machine in my life.  It is so great to be running multiple apps and see the Activity Monitor's CPU usage stay around 10%!  I really can't say more, I love this machine.	5.0	5.1042680740356445

No LINUX Drivers Available  I thought that I found my next laptop.  It has EVERYTHING that I've been looking for, except that I'm a UBUNTU LINUX user and this graphics card series IS NOT supported for use with LINUX.  Reference: [...]  I can't believe it!  Common ASUS, now I have to keep looking!	2.0	3.0003769397735596

My portable professional workhorse!  I love this laptop. It is lightweight, portable, and high powered. It isn't the lightest, most portable, or most powerful; but gets the job done in quick and stylish fashion. The display is awsome, the DVD+_RW is outstanding, the 64 bit mobile processor works very well, the combination of Wi-Fi, bluetooth, USB 2, and firewire is incredible in such a small package. The battery life has been wonderful. I am a professional IT person. I do "heavy lifting" with computers. I am not a gammer, and wouldn't recommend this laptop for that purpose (not that it would do poorly mind you... I'd just get something with a larger screen and dedicated RAM based video card), but for just about everything else it is wonderful. I have mine dual booting with XP Pro (shipped) and Linux Fedora. Drivers all seem to be working well for Linux which isn't the case for every laptop. If there is anything I would like to be different, it would be that the screen be SWXGA instead of just WXGA, but we can't have everything can we. This is a great buy!	5.0	5.160139560699463

Poor PC  I bought this notebook on 04/03/07.  Within one month one of the three USB ports became damaged.  It was too late for me to return it to Amazon for a full refund because 30 days had elapsed.  I called the manufacturer HP and they informed me that it would cost me around $400 to replace the motherboard.  I also had many compatability problems with Windows Vista.  It took me over 8 hours of technical support between my ISP Verizon Online, HP and Microsoft to get me connected to the Internet.  My wireless connection at hotspots like Starbucks, Borders ect. does not work.  I also had a problem configuring my Dell printer to work with Vista.  Stay clear from this laptop!	1.0	0.9050533771514893

Fatally flawed  I've used all kinds of laptops, including other Toshibas, with little or no problems. I purchased the S4747 because it has a built-in web cam and microphone and it was on sale. I opened the box and started using it even before checking reviews; that was my mistake. I've relearned the lesson that even with a good brand like Toshiba I should check reviews first!  I had the same "black screen of death" that other reviewers have mentioned. I worked with several technicians at Toshiba technical support for many, many hours trying to fix the problem (ticket 1-704536542). They were convinced that it was not a problem at all, rather, that the PC was simply going into hibernate mode, even though I repeatedly told them that the problem occurred while I was USING the PC and it was plugged in to power. Or, when I told them that I had to do a hard reboot to get the PC to work again, they would tell me that all I had to do was press the power button for a short time to bring it out of hibernate mode. It was extremely frustrating, though they were certainly "polite."  The black screen of death is bad enough, but it didn't happen every day. What is worse, in a way, is the cursor problem. If I rested my hands on the laptop while I typed, the cursor would jump all over the place, sometimes erasing entire sentences. This happened almost every paragraph, and I was forced to watch my typing so that I could reposition the cursor. Or, I was forced to keep my hands up and completely off the laptop, which resulted in arm fatigue after a page or two of typing. You can imagine how much this slowed my typing speed! At first, Toshiba technical support tried to tell me that I was getting my fingers, thumbs, or hands on the touchpad, causing the cursor to move, but I knew that wasn't the case. Then they thought that perhaps the touchpad itself was overly sensitive, that the vibrations on the case were causing the cursor to move. But they couldn't figure out how to adjust the touchpad or pointer sensitivity. Those parts of the operating system which control it were missing, and they didn't know why! At that point, after so many hours and so much frustration, I gave up and decided to return the laptop.  Some reviewers seem not to have any problems with their laptops. Does that mean there are quality control issues and only some of these models have problems? I don't know. But do you want to take the chance? I would have liked to keep this PC.  Update: A friend asked me to fix a problem with hibernation on her Toshiba laptop (a different model), and Toshiba tech support told me that I needed to reload Windows from the recovery CDs that came with the unit, which I did (ticket 1-718056769). Not only did this not fix the original problem, it created a new - and worse - problem with the video drivers. After more hours on the phone with Toshiba, they informed me that the software on the recovery CDs was corrupt and I needed a new set, which would cost $40. Since the laptop was still under warranty I objected to this charge, but I was told that is Toshiba policy. Between the bad customer support and the billing for defective parts under warranty, I don't think I'll be purchasing a Toshiba again.	1.0	0.9198732972145081
Great Laptop for the 8 Days it Worked...  I would advise potential purchasers to wait as long as they can so the bugs in the new MacBook can be ironed out.  I purchased a new MacBook in late July, and was wowed by its super-fast performace and all the great features that come with Tiger.  Glossy screen is also excellent.  However, after about 8 days it refused to shut down, and went into a hibernation.  I had to leave it for 2 days to exhaust the battery, and then put it on AC power and we were away again.  After that, it ran for 3 days, and then crashed like my old PC.  That was one week ago and it shows no sign of working ever again.  Several calls to Apple's support line to puzzled operators have failed to uncover what is going on.  several attempts to restart and reboot the computer have failed, and other than that they haven't been too forthcoming with positive solutions...  Because I didn't ring them within 10 days of purchase I can no longer get a replacement, thus will need to be without a laptop for some weeks whilst it is serviced.  this is not good news...  When you read the discussion forums at Apple.com, it seems the problem is fairly widespread.  So I do advise waiting a little while before buying, though surely they should have picked up a problem like this in testing? A few months wait should see an improved MacBook shipping, or do what I should have done, and spend a bit more to get the MacBook Pro.  Proceed with caution for the next little while!	2.0	1.9653372764587402
Works fine, condition leaves you wanting  The condition is listed as being "Good" which I think is a bit too generous. Condition is more "Fair at best." Having said that, I got a MacBook for only around $130, so beggars can't be choosers. As far as functionality, it works perfectly fine. It's what I'm typing on at this moment. So if you need a laptop cheaply, it's not a bad deal.	3.0	3.0077130794525146
Best computer on the market hands down  First, the operating system is that much better than windows. It does take a little getting used to if you aren't familiar with Macs, but once you get a good feel for where everything is located you realize that the system is much more intuitive and geared to the user than windows. The battery life is outstanding, the processor is incredibly fast, and if you get a solid state hard drive the thing is indestructible. I can't tell you how many times I've dropped mine with zero problems.	5.0	5.143155097961426
HP Pavilion dv5020us with GNU/Linux  I bought this laptop and as soon as I got it, cleaned it up and installed my favorite Linux Distros, now I have 15GB for Windows, 7GB for Debian (my favorite) 7GB for Kubuntu (trying it out) and 1GB for a future installation of Linux From Scratch, the other 50GB are for my data.  So far everything has worked well, except in kubuntu that I had to configure a "vesa" driver to get Xorg Working, but later updated to the ATI Driver and now, everythings works Great!!!  The Only thing I miss is a PS/2 Port for an external optical mouse I have.	5.0	4.040759563446045

Dead Pixel Marring Otherwise Great Computer/Amazon Comes Through!  ***** - 5 Stars  (UPDATED BELOW)  'Nuff said about how great this computer and Leopard are.  HOWEVER, out of the box I have one DEAD PIXEL just off center which shows as a black dot the size of a small period.  According to Amazon and Apple, one dead pixel is not enough to warrant replacement of a brand new computer.  I know it's one tiny pixel out of a million but once you notice it you always seem to see it.  It just seems to me that for $1300 you should be able to receive a computer without screen imperfections.  I wouldn't care about discoloration or scratches on the case but the screen should be perfect.  I don't buy Amazon's & Apple's excuse that this is acceptable: no Mac I've ever owned had dead pixels; none of my friends' Macs have dead pixels; none I've seen in Apple stores have dead pixels etc.  Had I purchased in an Apple store I could have walked in within 30 days and they would have swapped it out.  How can everyone I know and even my giant LCD TV not have any dead pixels but my brand new macbook has a permanent dot?  On-line buyers beware. (END OF ORIGINAL REVIEW)  UPDATE:  AMAZON HAS COME THROUGH WITH FLYING COLORS AND SENT ME A BRAND NEW MACBOOK WITH NO DEAD PIXELS AT NO CHARGE.  After a visit to the Apple Store (to confirm that if purchased there, they would replace it) I gave Amazon one more chance.  Using the call-back feature, customer service instantly called me and without any hassle, told me that they would replace my defective Macbook.  Sure enough, 1 day later my new Macbook arrived via FedEx and after staring intently at each and every pixel, I am completely satisfied.  This is the kind of customer service I would expect, and makes me very happy to use and recommend Amazon in the future.  A few things I've learned in this process.  If you're worried about pixel issues, as soon as you get your new computer, download a Pixel Checker program or change your background to Red, Green, Blue, White, Black (separately) and check for any stuck or dead pixels.  If there is a problem and you can live with it - enjoy your new computer, otherwise contact your dealer ASAP.  Also, I had much better results dealing with the telephone support people as opposed to trying to resolve this by email.  As long as Amazon takes care of its customers like this, I will be a lifelong user.  I wish I could change the star ratings to 5-star but you're not allowed to edit that.  This is really a great computer.  Super fast and perfect for my needs.  Weighs 5 lbs which is fine with me - not ultralight like the Airbook, but it seems lightweight enough to me.  Leopard is a great OS and the bundled programs are fun and easy to use.	3.0	3.0244197845458984

Everyone who gives it 5 stars... just wait!  Both me and my wife bought Macbooks at the same time and have encountered NUMEROUS mechanical problems with both.  I've sent my computer in twice, for problems, the second time I got a completely new computer but still have to put up with problems.  My wife has sent hers in twice as well.  We are totally sick of the hours we have wasted with their customer support pretending that the issues we are experiencing are something they've never heard of when their are websites dedicated to these Macbook problems.  So after spending a lot of money on the laptops we've finally come to accept our keyboards occasionally not working, trouble waking from sleep, but just recently both our screens have started flickering... I've just got to endure loosing my computer again to apple to fix...  Once my warranty runs out I know I've as good as lost this computer.  I loved Mac but after all this all I can say is do yourself a favor and avoid this laptop.	1.0	1.7832297086715698
After cleaning, paring, and loading updates, it works great.  Well, I agree with all the previous reviews except the poorly built comments.  I am very impressed with the hardware, except the tolerances of the battery compartment.  It does rattle, and I wouldn't travel with it as it is.  I put a couple pieces of tape on the case under the battery, and voila, no rattle.  With all the excrutiating design that Sony puts into these things, it does mystify me why this was overlooked. The case is solid otherwise, built of magnesium.  The processor, memory, wireless adapter, and hard drive is a great value for the money.  The 4800 rpm HDD is a bit slow, but once powered up works fine.  On the other hand, the T7250 processor and 2 Gb of memory standard is a good value.  I actually bought a FZ220E for $999, but found the FZ240E at Circuit City for only $50 more.  The 2.0 Ghz processor makes a big difference, not to mention the extra 50 Gb of storage.  Everything else is the same.  I agree with all the extraneous trial software.  I spent about an hour uninstalling it.  Well worth the time, but I agree with other reviewers that it shouldn't be there, or should be on a trial CD.  Once I removed the trial software, Office 2007, and Norton 360, it started working well.  I use Mcafee for virus software, as I have found the Norton software takes a lot of space and slows everything down.  I have adapted to Vista from XP, and it has its short comings as well as some good things.  But this isn't a Sony issue.  I must say, the Wireless setup was one of the easiest I have been through.  And the FZ series comes with a streaming media server, DLNA certified.  For those of you what want to stream to your TV or stereo, this is a big plus.  Not many other laptops in the price range do this.  Overall, I finally have it working well, and I am satisfied from a price and think it is a good value.	4.0	4.034907817840576

Dell D620 Laptop  The Laptop was received quickly. It was packaged well. It works and the battery holds a charge well. The charger works well also. The only issue I have is the seller(Open Electronics) specifically, in all capital letters, said the screen had no dead pixels but it has several. They also said , in all capital letters that there are no bad sectors. Since the screen has dead pixels I am skeptical about the lack of bad sectors. Over all I am mostly satisfied with the purchase. The dead pixils are scattered and barely effect the image. The response time is fast also. The CD and DVD player functions work well.	3.0	3.966269016265869
Nice and light and the price is right  I waffled for quite a while before finally settling on this model, and I think I made the right choice.  I really fell in love with the higher-priced Sony models, but this Toshiba seems to have everything you NEED...even if it's not as 'sexy' looking.  It is nice and light, at only 4.6 pounds.  It has a somewhat cheaper "feel" to it overall as compared to Sony Vaios or Dells, but of course, it IS cheaper!  (It is nowhere near as cheap-feeling as the bargain Acer/Lenova/etc types.)  I have experienced no problems getting used to the keyboard (though it does have a lot of flex).  The mouse click buttons are a little bit hard to press, and probably could have been designed better -- but again, this is not a high-end model, it's a very nice little affordable workhorse. It does come loaded with a lot of junk ("bloatware") that you don't need, but from what I hear, so do all of these pre-configured laptops.  Vista likes to give plenty of warnings as you remove items, so your first 24 hours will be filled with checking the "allow" and "continue" boxes.  ;-)  The processor seems quite fast; Vista takes some getting used to but is pretty user-friendly from what I've experienced; built-in wireless capability seems to be working great.  I am not experiencing a short battery life as other users mentioned, it seems more than adequate (I do turn down screen brightness to get more time out of it).  160 GB of storage...don't know that I would ever be able to fill that up!  By the way, I was able to pick up this model for six hundred ninety-nine bucks from Best Buy, a hundred bucks less than Amazon currently sells it.  On a somewhat less important cosmetic note, when you look at this laptop in all but the brightest or most direct sort of lighting, it appears black.  The lid is glossy, too, not matte as it can appear in pictures.  Hope this helps...feel free to leave comments with any questions -- I know how annoyingly difficult it is to decide on a laptop!  :-)	4.0	4.043469429016113
I don't believe it  I recently bought this computer, the first time that I turn on the computer everything seems to be working just fine. The second time the computer put itself a BIOS password and now I cannot access my laptop, I researched about this and apparently this is a well know Toshiba issue and they don't do anything about it. I call costumer service and they told me that I should take my computer to the support company in my country and wait for their solution. THIS IS THE FIRST AND LAST TIME I BOUGHT A TOSHIBA. DELL is much better concerning new computers and costumer support.	1.0	2.8184990882873535
It worthes $100  I knew the company made too much profit one it, but still could not help buy got one at $390 at this beginning of the year after reading all the positive reviews. 1. Bad technical support. Emailed two questions, no answer. 2. Card reader constantly has error when it is hot in summer. 3. Less powerful cpu (actual speed 600MHz). I added 2G memory. They are useless with such cpu. Cannot properly play the popular MKV format movie. 4. It is small, but it does not fit my pocket. I don't see much difference with a normal laptop when carrying it for travel. 5. The key board is too small. Those who has a PDA with mini key board knows it. 6. I am wondering whether all those positive reviews are from the true users.  Wish I had bought a much powerful laptop at the same price I paid for this one.	2.0	1.9824336767196655
Save 58 cents!!!!!oneone111!!!  I followed a google ad link promising a "blow out sale" on the day that the new Mac Books were unveiled (as well as the new $999 price for the low end model). I am truly amazed that I can save a whole 58 cents! I'm practically creaming my jeans! Sadly, the exact same model is now available for nearly $100 less from Apple. Wake up, Amazon!

Do not order from this seller!  I ordered a Dell Latitude D600 from this seller...and what a mistake that was...when the computer arrived it was broken! it just came apart..at first the seller was trying to blame me what a joke..I just received the computer..I had to return the computer using my own money which was not cheap for them to find out that it was not assembled right. It took them another twice weeks to send me back another computer all this time I have not computer to work with after I have paid for one. After two long weeks I get the other computer delivered to me..finally I have a computer that work...so that is what I was thinking...plug it in thinking the power cord work..and my computer went dead...the power cord did not work!! so now I have a computer with no working power cord! I contacted the seller again..and he made me out to be a liar saying it was a new cord (which it was not)and I had to be joking.. he claims he would send me another one out..well that has been since August this is now Oct..and no power cord still to this day the power cord has never arrived..I can't afford to spend even one more penny to send this thing back so its seats in my closet...I have since purchase a new computer which I should have done in the first place. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER OR YOU WILL BE SORRY YOU DID. Buy new...oh beat this...one more for the road...the "G" key is broken...and its an old computer in maybe ok shape at best..what a waste of time and money...buy new.	1.0	0.9048515558242798

Asus eee pc 2gb surf  The eee pc 2gb surf is a great mini laptop to use for basic computing such as school work, business travel, listening to media, and surfing the web. As soon as I opened it from the box, it has worked well with no problems. You do not have to know linux to operate, only if you wish to download software, but with the 2gb version thats a bit of a problem. It doesn't come with alot of pre-installed programs for you to be able to download software like limewire,or shockwave player but overall its a great piece of work. The 4gb version and bigger drive models work better for adding software on to it. If you do not know how to run the terminal, the great thing about linux is that if you any trouble shooting you  can always find help online from forums and better yet it is free. The great thing too is that all its office programs are compatible with microsoft so when you save a document or presentation it can run on windows without any tweaking.	4.0	4.056159496307373
Great deal, awesome computer  So it isn't sleek and streamlined like your modern laptops.  Not like I plan on racing the thing.  I do find the black matte metal case incredibly appealing, like I could run over it and it would still work, or perhaps use it to bash apart a fancy new laptop.  The main reason I bought this computer was because I needed to free up some hard drive space on my PC so the games had to go.  I got a free memory/hard drive upgrade with my ThinkPad so I've been merrily cramming it with resource-hog games and they play loads better than I'd expected.  I may load a few graphics programs to see how well they work.  Like older laptops it does get quite hot which makes the DVD/CD drive a bit cranky sometimes but my last desktop PC did the same thing so I can deal with it.  The fan is a bit loud but not distracting.  I probably have the original battery because it's only good for about two hours but since I normally use the power cord anyhow it hasn't been a problem.  I may order a new battery if I start carrying it around.  Big "meh" on the nipple mouse.  I haven't gotten the hang of it and for the moment it's disabled but I'll give it another go since it is staring at me with that baleful red eye.	5.0	4.001270294189453
Very disappointing  I was so excited when I bought this laptop, and was happy to pay the costs because it is so light and powerful. It was too good to be true. Three days after the purchase, it completely froze. I took it back to the shop, and the assistant did a total reboot and said it was the extra software. The computer seemed to be working fine. Yesterday, 3 weeks after the purchase, it froze again. Hours before a crucial meeting, I could not access my files, or anything in the computer, which seemed to be overheating (the cable was faulty too). I took it back to the shop for good- I wanted this model so bad, and all I have had is one headache after another. The design is great, and the lightness is amazing, it feels like you are carrying a book or a thick magazine instead of a laptop. The graphics are also very impressive. But: The screen is hard to clean, the computer comes with way too much trial software and yet without recovery CDs, and the instruction leaflet is online only- so if you have problems with the computer you cannot read the instruction manual. I expected something else for this price. The design is great, but what do you want a sleek frozen computer for?	2.0	1.966665506362915
Used Dell Latitude D620 laptop  I used the same laptop at work for the about the last 3 years, and it is a work horse. I can buy a brand new commercial laptop for couple hundred bucks more, but I wanted the reliability of the professional business laptop. I have to say this used business machine Laptop works well except for 3 problems: First, the battery only lasts 5 minutes, second, the DVD burner drive work sporadically (DVD door doesn't eject consistently, and it doesn't always detect the DVD or CD in it). Handed the laptop to my 11 year old daughter few weeks after purchase (Christmas gift), so I did not find out about these problems until 2 month after purchase. Contacted the seller, but the warrantee had expired after 30 days of purchase, so I have to buy a battery and drive on my own. Third thing, the XP pro operating system was loaded on the computer, but the recovery disks were not included; I hope the hard the hard drive doesn't crash sometime soon.	2.0	2.507089614868164
Apple Laptops can be doorstops  I bought a Titanium laptop - at full price several years ago when they were the new hot thing. It has never been much more than a door stop. It came with a 10 GB hard drive, the operating system took up most of that space.  I also purchased extra memory from the merchant (MacMall) which was installed at time of purchase.  I had never before been disappointed in a Mac - it was my 4th mac purchase.  Because it was such a dog, I never used it much and finally well after warranty it broke. I brought it to the "genius" bar, on the north shore of Massachusetts, for help. They took it in, fixed the problem...  it wasn't a memory problem, but they insisted on removing the additional memory because it wasn't apple memory - making the machine more of a dog than before.  So finally I take it again on vacation and I am so frustrated, I try the "genius" bar again at Derby Street mall in Hingham. they could not get me more "apple" memory, they could not put in a bigger hard drive. They were supercilious and dismissive , I assume because I didn't have the latest and greatest mac - I have a top of the line G5 at home. like I would think about buying another laptop from apple after this experience?  Just really want you to know what it is like to deal with the bad side of Apple.  I figure at somewhere around $2500 - I have maybe used it 20 times if that - I spent over $100 per use. Call me a very disappointed laptop customer.  Moira Ashleigh	1.0	3.041759967803955

New (refurbished) MAC to me  I have always used a PC, mainly because that's what they had where I used to work.  Now that I'm retired I've decided to expand my horizons, and ordered my very first MAC, and it is great!	5.0	5.141757488250732
A really great piece of equipment for the price  For the price, this laptop was a steal. Of course it doesn't have the features of a $2000 laptop, but it fits my needs perfectly. I mainly watch videos and listen to music with it, and these speakers and the monitor are probably the best around. I have not had a single problem or complaint about this computer and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a powerful computer and not break the bank at the same time.	5.0	5.12319803237915
Disappointing purchase  Old laptop and looks it, really used badly by a school (so scuffed that the color white is missing on the bottom), no passwords so I can't download anything.  It's a real disappointment.  Took a long time, a really long time to figure out wifi connectability.	2.0	1.304603099822998
Survived 6 foot fall  I knocked my MacBook off my bunk bed.  It was wide open and fell six feet onto a hardwood floor.  It hit the ground and made the classic boot-up sound.  I thought for sure it was done with, but fortunately it is built TOUGH!  I opened it and it booted without incident.  The screen joints are a little bent, but a little elbow-grease will fix that.	5.0	4.038172245025635
leaves something to be desired in the software & sound dept !  I put aside my IBM think pad for this Laptop by toshiba (Satellite L305-S5909 ) I was hoping to get a top self with all the software I needed & wanted I figured I would have to upgrade the software at some point But Not have to buy it ! (Except Home and student And Norton ) after seeing and reading the software installed in the ad it would lead you to believe home and student is a 60 day trial well ok ! But it costs over $150. and norton360 $60. + and Microsoft Works is only availible IF you buy Home & Student ! Windows Photo Shop is not complete Microsoft has removed most of the quality editing software and in order to Manage & Edit your Photos properly and easily you need the Photo Manager to get it you have to Microsoft Works !! And thats the short list of short commings I found,  "Very Disapointing" ! The sound system (speakers) Have no tone adj anywhere in microsoft media the result is The Sound is Sounding as though its comming thru 2 tin Cans varying only with the music quality !! Basicly I bought a toshiba with all Microsofts new ideas that in my opinion are some of the worst ! they have taken all user control out of all the good programs ! WHY. As far as speed performance of the processor well its icredibly fast and the memory is as advertised ! JUST an FYI with norton installed you may have a problem with redundancy of the firewalls the windows fire wall sort of insists that it be on and can go on on its own causing a lock up of explorer and some websites you won`t be able to access if they are both on. I think i`m going back to my XP For windows ! Vista not worth the minor problems * One More thing 64 bit is better than 32 bit except you`ll find almost no exsiting ad on programs are compatable withit yet !	3.0	3.017721176147461
Great Laptop for the Price  I recently purchased this laptop at Best Buy and I am incredibly satisfied with it thus far.  The one thing I made sure to do right away was to purchase 2GB of RAM when I got the laptop as mine only came with 1GB total (it had 2 512MB modules in it).  This allows me to do more multitasking and have overall better performance (since Vista alone needs nearly 1GB of RAM just to work).  I was able to install the new 1GB modules myself without any problem, the owners manual that accompanies the laptop shows you exactly how to do it in an easy-to-understand manner.  The screen is brilliant and the keyboard is easy on the hands.  I will mainly be using this computer for word processing and internet research (I am currently a full-time graduate student).  However, this laptop is also compatible with iTunes and other popular media programs so I can listen to music, move songs to and from my iPod with the laptop, and also watch DVDs and streaming videos online with no problems.  It is also equipped with a wireless internet card so you can go wireless with it right out of the box without any hassle.  I've noticed some people here have given this product bum reviews, and I think they must either have too high of standards for a basic model laptop or that they don't really know much about computers and their performance in the first place.  One thing I found right off the bat was the multitude of unnecessary software that comes preinstalled with this laptop (as with pretty much all Windows-based computers today).  The first thing you should do after turning your laptop on is to uninstall all the software you know you won't be using.  This will free up space and increase performance as you eliminate programs you won't need.  People interested in buying this laptop should also purchase additional RAM, as my model only came with 1GB.  I bought 2GB RAM at Best Buy for $60, and the investment was well worth it.  I have no issues with having multiple webpages up, iTunes playing music, and word processing all at the same time.  The people who have bashed this computer seem to not understand that certain steps need to be taken to improve overall performance, especially on base models like the Satellite A205.  Toshiba is a great company, and this laptop is no disappointment by any means.  I would highly recommend this laptop to any student who is on a budget and needs a computer for school.  I would not recommend this laptop to hardcore gamers (the video card isn't built for those as it's a basic model), video editors (if you're doing video editing you should be using a Mac laptop), or those who demand incredibly high performance for complicated programs that need a higher performing machine to run them.  I hope this review helps some people, espeically students who need a quality laptop at a fair price.  For people who want a higher performing laptop for gaming or other reasons, I would look to a higher model Toshiba with more featuers.  But for basic everyday use (internet browsing, music, word processing, etc.) this laptop is perfect.  The only reason this didn't get 5 stars was the lack of a higher performing video card if I do decide to do some gaming at some point in the future.  However, since this is a basic model it's acceptable and I'm completely happy with it!	4.0	4.042747974395752

I LIKE it!  I got this little puppy for three reasons - (1)  It was lightweight and easy to cart around, (2) It was inexpensive but still had WiFi and other features that made it a good deal for me, and (3) I can take it on cruises and use it for quick download/upload on those pricey internet connections there!  I like it a lot!  Haven't used it too much yet, and I did get a separate wireless mouse because I hate those little pads.  But it picks up the internet just fine WiFi-Wise, and the keyboard's not that hard to get used to (small, of course, but maybe a big meaty guy would have more trouble).  The true test will be a 2-week cruise in Dec.  Hey, $300... I spend that much in a month at restaurants and buying gas.  This little guy will last a while.  Diane	4.0	4.056516170501709
Love My iBook!  I  just got my iBook less than a week ago, and let me tell you, I wonder how I did without it! It is one great notebook. I'm a recent convert from P.C. to Mac and I'm still learning this operating system. I ordered my book from the Apple Store with 768MB RAM and 80 GB on the hard drive. I've paired it with the airport extreme base and the wireless mouse. What a cool feeling to be able to surf the net from the comfort of my bed and anywhere in my home! The display on this baby is gorgeous, and watching DVDs is a blast...I originally wanted to get the 14" because I was used to that size screen, then thought it might be a drag to carry around, but now I do not regret my decision to get the 12", because it works very well for my purposes. At under 5lbs (4.9 to be exact) it is very easy to handle on the go and it takes up considerably less space than the 14". I really enjoy being able to access the net from my favorite cafe and when I'm in school. The OS is very nice and it's a relief to be free of pop-up ads and the blue screen of death. Apple provides great customer service too. Since I'm still learning a lot from this new animal, there's not much more to say now. Finally, this is one gorgeous little machine! I'm extremely pleased with it and I can't imagine anyone having regrets who buys this book. Now, if only I can get my hubby away from it...	5.0	5.142671585083008
Great computer!  I bought this computer bc I travel a ton and am always wanting to look up trip advisor reviews and/or book hotels, book activities while on vacation, check email, etc.  Really the main purpose I needed it was to browse the internet.  It has that and so much more!  I am able to download some compatible games that keep me busy on the airplane as well as have IM chat, MS Office compatible software, software to download and listen to music/videos from my ipod, etc.  It has worked out great!  And it is so light, that you barely notice it. The only issues I can see is that I wish they would have made the speakers on the side of the screen smaller and enlarged the screen.  Also, it was a bit tough to get used to Linux OS since I am usually working in Windows, but after reading online on the ASUS support sites, I was able to get through it.  I probably would buy a Windows next time just to avoid any compatibility issues. Overall it is a great, scaled down computer.  I can even link it to a large monitor at home and it is essentially my main computer!  We are thinking of buying another one.	4.0	4.097425937652588
Bought Jan 2008 - 1st repair Aug 2008  For MAC newbies  I can't review the specs of the machine I will leave it to the experts but I will discuss what happened after my MAC broke down.  The experience:  My computer started to act up I tried to troubleshoot the problem on apple.com.  After a few days of the "self IT help", I took it to the Apple store during lunch. I was asked if I had an appointment.  I was told to take it to another Apple store they were too busy.  Finally with some understanding that my $1,500 computer had problems and that it didn't matter if it was at home or at the store for a week they let me drop it off.  A Genius tech was able to put in a test part until replacement parts came into the Apple store.  Note: on the form that you sign a potential $100 charge may apply to your service.  The appointment:  They got the parts in and I made an appointment. An appointment doesn't mean immediate help but possibly around your appointed time on a shared basis with another person that has an appointment too for the IPhone or IPOD. Translation more waiting time.  As a user my preference:  Let me know that as a Genius you may delete something that I did not save.  I lost my favorites on Safari. Fortunately, I was able to figure out that if I go to my trash I will find the bookmark.plist file and restore my bookmarks.  Apple store please let me tell you my computer problems and fix it having the choice to leave it over  your preference of me making an appointment.  Scratching my head over Apple's strategy:  They have the sales strategy down to a science, but the backend support needs an overhaul.  Why do they think it is value added to have the potential new customers of their products stand and wait with people having problems.  From my experience at lunch time and during the evening the wait could be long and frustrating.  Final- As a PC user interfacing with the MAC is great.	5.0	1.9812440872192383

what's not to love  I have recently purchased white macbook with 2.16 Ghz processor and 2 Gb of RAM.  I have NEVER before used a mac and was a little nervous but my husband and I wanted to try something new.  Our Dell laptop was getting outdated and we had to buy a new machine.  And you know what?  I have been doing a lot of research and every time I would come back to a mac.  So we took the risk and here I am typing this review on my new beautiful macbook :)  To be on a safe side, I have bought a "Macbook for Dummies" book, but honestly you do not even need it.  OS REALLY is intuitive.  These are no lies.  Well, I hadn't have a chance to play around with Windows Vista (I am a stay at home mom, so I am a little bit not out there any more so to speak) but from what I heard, it takes after OS used on macs.  Why shouldn't it?  Moving from Windows XP is quite an experience but there is nothing to be afraid of.  It is a pleasure.  Seriously.  If you are considering purchasing a new computer, consider mac. I am 99% sure you will not regret it.	5.0	5.127620220184326
Happy Traveler  I bought this laptop for my technically challenged better half and consider the purchase a success. The pro's are that my wife can use it without much of my intervention and that makes both of us happy. The cons are the preloaded Nortons anti-virus software, seems to annoy her and we'll probably unload it in due course.  The best part is the small form factor and great display. The juries out on the battery life. I highly recommend this laptop for the technically challenged! Enjoy!!!	5.0	5.149526119232178
I had to return it!  The specs on this notebook are better than any comparable ones I have found anywhere for $1500. The screen is great, its fast, powerful, has blue ray, and lots of TV tuner stuff I didn't need. What I didn't like.......... I happened to get a new one with defects. The internet explorer locked up daily which is not cool. There was also a rattle inside the case on the left near one of the hard drives, that rattled when typing or using the touch pad (which was very good. Not too sensitive.)The internet explorer would lock up daily if the unit was left on in any mode for more than a few minutes. It wasn't a virus or anything I installed. It was probably a vista problem but I never could get it to stop. The screen also dims way too much when unplugged. Not a good feature! The battery could be at 100% but the screen would dim regardless as soon as it was unplugged by some 30%. Made it very difficullt to see. There was included a lot of TV tuner stuff thats really not needed. I wish they would remove all that uneccessary TV stuff and work on the screen dimming.  I reaaly liked the notebook. The problems I had were immediate, streight out of the box. There was no replacement available so I had to return it. I must have gotton one of those 5% thats defective. It sucks but it happens. I haven't seen any reviews that have had similar problems so maybe its an isolated problem.  Overall, the notebook is a great buy......but with the screen dimming like it does (lenovos do the same thing), the problems I had with it brand new, it still gets a 3 just for the specs. and performance. Its almost a perfect comp. as long as you take along the plug.  Ill probably buy another one!	3.0	3.0005993843078613
The touchpad is fine. Please read your manual  I have an PCG-V505ECP. The touchpad was a little bit confusing in the beginning but after I read the online manual the mistery is solved. The touchpad actually work both as mouse and scroll wheel. When you slide your finger along the right side of the pad, it activates the scrolling mode. This is configurable if you don't like it, although I agree they probably should put some hint (such as a color strip) on the touchpad so people will aware of it at the first place. The wireless 802.11b works fine for me. I've use it for only a few days but I like it a lot. The battery life almost as good as they described (maximum 6 hours if you don't use any power-consuming features). Also it comes with the support of Java by default.  The only thing bothers me is that there are too many trial software (AOL, MS Office 2003 60-day trial) so I need to spend one hour to uninstall them.	4.0	3.606168270111084
Not bad for what it is  I tried both the 2 GB surf and the 4 GB surf. For the extra $50, the 4 GB is a better investment, with a much larger cache and a faster processor, plus the memory can be upgraded. If the 2 GB was say, $229, I'd agree is was a good investment for modest web browsing, email, and Skype VOIP if you and your friend have a fast connection.  Unfortunately, the 2 GB barely played my MPEG4s, which was very disappointing since even a cheap player can usually play videos at a reasonable bitrate without a hitch.  The 4 GB unit played MPEG4s much better, and even tried to play videos from the NBC website, but unfortunately didn't quite have the power to keep the video playing smoothly. But at least it tried, something my wife's Nokia n800 couldn't do at all.  I also use ORB for remote viewing of my media center recordings, and with the 4 GB Asus, this was a little hit or miss.  If I could have watched online videos (NBC, TNT, CBS, FOX) without the buffering I would likely have kept one. But they're just under the wire for enough processing speed to satisfy. Still, the used market for these should create great value later when Asus comes out with their new units.  I think the niche for these devices is probably overall about $50 lower than they have set them, though certainly for someone looking for basic features and ultra portability, these are nice units. The web browser works better and is larger than a PDA and the cost is less, too.  The included OpenOffice software is very reliable, and even the 2 GB unit is compatible with a number of printers. I plugged one into an Epson R200 and it installed the needed drivers and pages printed quick and clean.  To me the ideal market for these is families needing something for their kids for homework research and even texting (Pidgin) and free VOIP (Skype). Sound with Skype is a little "tinny" but can probably be overcome with a decent quality headset.  Bottom line is, you're not getting a laptop, you're getting an extremely portable web browser with basic communication and productivity software, and don't expect a lot of power.	3.0	2.999645471572876

Bloated with crapware  Unreasonably slow. Turns out all the "trial" stuff put on made it run like mud. Spent 3 hours uninstalling all the BLOAT. Then it was okay. But not worth all the time lost. There are too many good alternatives - HP, Lenovo, Dell, Toshiba, Acer. If I could I'd send Sony a bill for $300 just for the time it took to get this thing down to a NEW conditon.	1.0	0.9041928648948669
Great overall, but extremely disapointed battery life!  This review is intended for current PC users who is thinking about getting a MacBook. I'll just point out some of the issues I have faced.  I have been a PC user for 7 years. I'm using this MacBook for my college, and I have been using it for only a month.(Please be gentle, I will update my review later if anything changes)  First thing that really bothers me is the battery life. I travel quite often, so battery life is a big deal to me. This MacBook claimed to have up to 6 hours of battery life, which is a lie!. In real life, it only last around 3 hours. Even I turned off bluetooth, wireless, dim the the screen, I might be lucky to get around 3.5 hours. If you run Macbook under Windows mode, the battery life drop to 2.5 hours. The only way you can get your macbook run for up to 6 hours is dimming your screen to darkest, not running any applications, and turning off wireless & bluetooth..Don't believe me? Go to different forums and search battery topics. My last laptop claimed to have up to 5 hours of battery life, which it did last around 4--5 hours even after 2 years.  If your previous laptop only have 1 or 2 hours of battery life, I guess 3 hours will be a little bit "upgrade" for you. On top of the short battery life, this macbook battery can get very hot, you can burn your lap if you put it there long enough.  There are good things about Macbook. It is very easy to upgrade and install the memories. It only cost me around $60 to upgrade to 2GB ram, and I installed it very easily without much of an effort. The same configuration, Sony could easily cost around $2000, and macbook only cost $1300.  I have always wanted a MacBook, because it is cute and stylish, but the Mac OS system always make me hesitated. I finally got it after I found out it also run windows now. It is very easy to install windows on MacBook with bootcamp. They suggest you to print out the instructions, which is not necessary, all you need to do is follow the instructions on screen.  If you get used to using windows softwares, you will find many of them have very limited functions when under Mac OS, and sometimes they don't even have Mac version.  The bootcamp I used was 1.3, it does have some incompatibility issues. The volume and brightness control keys, disk eject keys are not working under windows. I hope all these problems will be fixed in the future. Since there is no right click button, you have to use two fingers tap on the touch pad and click as right click. Some new MacBook users might have problems in the beginning.  It is not hard to learn the Mac OS, and there are many great programs are specially designed for Mac. The office 2004 for Mac is great for college student, one of the function is you can record the lecture while you are typing down the notes.  I strongly recommend this laptop. It works just like a regular laptop, but it can run in both of the world. :-P  PS: the white macbook does get dirty easily, get Glass Plus Wipes, it will do the trick to make your laptop look new again. (test on a little corner first if you have doubts)  (Sorry for my broken English, and sorry if I offended some mac lovers..)	4.0	4.101072311401367
My first Mac and my first Laptop (4.5 stars)  Like many other long time PC users I'd often wondered what the Mac was all about.  After working in a new department that is exclusively Apple, I decided I like Macs because they are simple to use and pleasant to look at.  I've had the Powerbook since it came out and it's a great machine.  It has never frozen up once or had any system problems at all.  Its super fast and it connects to any wireless network very easily with a very strong signal.  The screen is beautiful and glossy although a bit hard to clean...you really have to get screen wipes.  I love having a central portable hub for all my music (IPOD) pictures and movies and the sound is great (with headphones....the speakers are worthless)  For me the keyboard fits my hand perfectly and I really like using all the Apple shortcuts to speed up the interface.  The only downside is the machine does run very hot so you really need to use it on a table or with a buffer in between your legs.  I guess the biggest criticisms of Macs are their price and program incompatibility.  So yes, you are paying for aesthetic beauty but we do that in many items we purchase so why not with computers?  As to their lack of product support, with the introduction of the Intel chip and their ability to run Windows, that won't really be an issue.  Bottom Line:  A great laptop computer with simplicity and style for around 1100.00 (with student discount through Apple)	4.0	5.096983909606934
Yes, It's all about style  I bought the 675PH model direct from Sony.  Sony should attach a letter of appology to every one of these computers. While it's beautiful, elegant and the screen is superb, the wireless on these machines is a complete joke. I have applied all of the updates to eliminate dropping connections (why should I even have to do this??), and this thing still performs like a pig. Slow doesn't begin to describe it.  I have a Dell 610 with identical Centrino and it is spectacularly fast. It's ugly, poor keyboard, but it works perfectly.  This Sony runs very well on wired connection, but can't a company of this size get serious about what customers think of their products and test them before shipping?	3.0	3.9507181644439697
NO EVALUATION. I PAID FOR THE COMPUTER BUT NEVER RECEIVED IT.  PERHAPS THIS IS A WAKE-UP CALL TO STOP SHOPPING ONLINE	2.0	0.9295564293861389
Freezes Constantly  At first I had no problems with the laptop and thought it looked and performed rather nicely, but soon I realized that it FREEZES CONSTANTLY. Every single time I use it it freezes up, without fail. It boots up quickly, but freezes again sometimes right afterwards! I am not doing anything to exhaust it except browsing the web. It is EXTREMELY annoying. Also another review on here says it has a backlit keyboard...the one I am using definitely doesn't have a backlit keyboard.	3.0	1.9487966299057007
Watch out for the memory!!!  Windows Vista requires 2GB RAM MINIMUM to run. To run other applications you will need at least 3GB RAM. I had mistakenly gotten a 2GB model and at times it takes 45 seconds just to send soemthing to the recycle bin or else a reboot is required. Painfully SLOW!!!  Also, the tablet doesn't work properly. There is a distinct discrepancy between the location you place the pen and the location the computer recognizes. I gave up on the tablet aspect of my laptop. This laptop also runs really hot. The longer you use, the higher the temperature. The higher the temperature, the slower the laptop. Running it for over three hours without a fan blowing on it is out of the question. The only nice things nice about it are the included games (which you can't uninstall) and the 12.1" size (so light!).  Think I'll upgrade to a Sony. My Sony desktop has been quite reliable for the last 5 years and still running strong. Haha, in fact, it's faster at running graphics applications than the HP, especially after the HP heats up.	1.0	0.9059653282165527
Great product... read review for why :)  I received this 15" MacBook Pro on my 18th birthday and although I am still loyal to my beloved PC at home... Mac is my new favorite at school :) It's a lot smoother and simpler than Windows and the programs that are preinstalled (and FREE!) are amazing to say the least :) When ordering this product, the only "built in" option I'd say you absolutely NEED is the speed upgrade from "5400 rpm" to "7200 rpm". If money is not an issue for you, then of course I'd recommend buying ALL the options lol, but if you have a budget (like most of us)...  REASON (for purchasing speed upgrade): As you gradually save more information/programs on your laptop (whether it's a Mac OR PC)... you will start to see a decrease in speed on your system. With the upgrade, as your computer slows down it will then eventually become as fast as it would've been in the first place WITHOUT the upgrade. Yes, you could always purchase the doubled memory (preinstalled is $700/separate is $500) OR you could save your specific files on USB memory drives! Maybe it's only because I'm a student... but I've discovered it's easier to save all my documents/pictures/videos/web history for each class on these drives (and it also develops my organization skills! lol). I have 6 classes and with 2GB USBs at $20 each that's only $120.  By doing this, the only thing slowing down your computer will be programs you later install or download... and the decrease in your system's speed will occur 1/2 as quickly than if you'd been saving EVERYTHING on it.  If you're interested in any other information I can give you about this (or any computer), email me at RachelLMayo@gmail.com :) I'd be more than happy to help!	4.0	4.9413018226623535
Easy to get hot, no tech support  It gets hot in a few minutes, and sometimes have problem with the internal card reader. Emailed tech support twice. No response. The company can fire the tech support and reduce the price of the pc. For the same price, I'd buy a normal laptop which is much more powerful.	2.0	1.9883924722671509
Excellent  This was my first Mac. I switched to Apple from PC and nver looked back. This was the best (if you compare amongst similar capabilities) computer that I ever had. Faster to start, never froze, no viriouses, never crashed. Once you get used to the differnt apple system, it is actually very fun to work with.  The cherry on top is the design.  Buy it.	5.0	5.146736145019531
defective product  i ordered this product and after receiving the product and shipping it to a different country i found out that there is a dead pixel in the screen. and the warranty was voided. I contacted apple but they didn't provide any useful information via the web or the customer service call. thats why i rated this store with 1 star and became not so fan about apple for the reason i feel not respected by apple or the store i bought the product from	1.0	0.9056015610694885
Running Dragon on the MacBook is impressive  Ok, so I'm a newbie to Apple stuff, having cut my teeth on IBM PC1 back in the dark ages with DOS. Bought a MacBook Pro; used Boot Camp to install WinXP; installed Dragon Naturally Speaking 8. Have not received my 1Gb RAM yet so I was running on 512. Left my favorite Sennheiser microphone at the office (*Duh*), so I had to use my old Andrea stand-by 'mike,' but....  Dragon literally flies on MacBook Pro. Installation was slick.  Everything worked as planned. I dictated normally, and DNS was very accurate. Then I started dictating faster, with longer, more complicated paragraphs, and it did very well -- in fact, extremely well (this is just with the quick ten-minute training session and without allowing DNS to scour my emails/documents to learn my style). Ok, so it missed 'egregious' and gave me 'courageous' -- so big whoop. My wife was amazed at how accurate and fast it was. Even my son, the technogeek, was impressed -- and nothing I do in his tech-savvy life impresses him. Actually, the MacBook was more his idea than mine -- we just decided to try it with DNS for the heck of it.  I have been using Dragon for years, and I currently run it on a Thinkpad Centrino and a dual core Intel PC, and I can honestly say Dragon on the MacBook runs better, faster and more accurately than it does on either of my other machines -- and I was getting good results with them. I have to say I was very skeptical that the MacBook would come close to my other machines, but I was wrong. I realize my testing is subjective without hard, empirical data to back up my claims, but I don't care -- I'm going with the MacBook for now b/c I have a feeling it's going to save me a lot of time, blood, sweat and tears.  The MacBook is an extremely sexy machine, and it has so many cool features on the Mac side that Windows simply can't match. I know we MS junkies are all waiting for Vista to salvage Windows (and Bill's $$$ advantage over Warren), but IMHO it's simply going to be a quasi knock-off of OSX. By then, Apple's OS will be even further ahead. I wish I could say good bye to Windows, but unfortunately, almost all of my work has to be done with a PC b/c very little software that I am 'forced' to use is written for Apple machines. Fortunately, at least I'll be able to dictate using my MacBook running WinXP and DNS.  At any rate, if any of you wonder if the MacBook and DNS (running under XP) might be a good marriage, I'd say yes. I'll do some more testing when I get the other stick of RAM and my favorite microphone installed and get DNS up to speed with all my documents. I know $2000 is a lot to pay for a laptop when you can do it much more cheaply, but I have to say I'm very satisfied so far from what I've seen.  Have not heard the 'high-pitched' whine/hiss others report, but I only got it yesterday.  Hope I can slide by that one....	5.0	4.05986213684082
Great Design- Horrible Service - HP Lost the Computer! Claims no Responsibility  Amazon is a great company and have many great buys on line here, however HP Buyer's please be wary.  If you never have a problem with your computer, you will likely be happy.  However if you send it in for service, you may be in big trouble.  I sent mine in for a broken battery latch. This, by the way, was extremely weak for the task of holding the battery in the housing.  However, the worst part is that I shipped it to HP under warranty.  HP service is now claiming that they shipped it back to me, however they can not give me a valid tracking number.  They say I should take my troubles to Fed/Ex.  Ladies and Gentlemen, I am out the cost of the computer as far as I can tell and HP is claiming no responsibility.  HP LOST the computer.	1.0	0.9183191657066345
nice hardware, useless OS and crap ware  It is really a shame that such a nice laptop is ruined by Sony's crapware. The first boot experience is the most unpleasant I have had to date. All these trial packages (AOL, McAffee, Sprint WAN and other useless crap) completely ruin the user experience. Just for this reason I would not buy this product. If any of you decide to buy it, do yourselves a favor and format the hard drive and install everything yourselves. Make sure you don't pay the microsoft tax though.	3.0	2.9154393672943115

Overall this product performs descently. granted Vista isn't as good as Microsoft claims it to be and trying to downgrade to a earlier OS isn't easy for compatibility issues.

Not to worry; excellent machine  After may hours of hand wringing and research on Intel HD 3000 integrated graphics, I placed an order. Then, even though I knew it was a mistake, I began reading the amazon reviews. Many reviews mentioned that this MBP was absolutely worthless for playing games and how it overheated. More hand wringing ensued. I didn't want the 15 inch. I had an early 2006 macbook and the 13 inch was just so portable and perfect I couldn't stand going to a 15". Plus the macbook 2006 spoiled me being able to lounge on the couch and play/work/surf/stay connected; lazy wins again.  I have had it for about a week now and I really couldn't be happier. I won't go into all of the cool productivity applications MacOSX come bundled with because if you are thinking of buying one you probably know about them. This little guy knocks them all out. I want to address specifically the gaming and the overheating issues. I have played WoW with near maxed out settings and it looks beautiful. Left for Dead with moderate settings and team fortress 2 with moderate settings. Both with very little trouble. Youtube has a variety of demo's that show Crisis and other higher end games running just fine. Truth is if you like to play games this can do it and pretty darn well. Its no monster gaming PC but I have built several of those over the past 10 years and I have come to the conclusion that being a minimalist is far more appealing than being chained to a giant machine that requires a substation to power. Not to mention the sinking feeling you get as you watch the state of the hardware you bought plummet in value. Conversely, Macs by design are meant to endure longer and retain there value.  The Intel HD 3000 integrated graphics is on par with many entry level discrete video cards; most benchmark sites will confirm this. In addition, they are relatively new and as drivers are perfected and more development companies become more familiar with them, the overall experience should improve. Most people bristle when they hear "integrated graphics"; in my opinion this is not your older brothers integrated  graphics system. The architecture is fundamentally different; I won't go into detail, but Google it if you'd like to understand more.  That leads me into the overheating issue. I used SMC fan control to monitor my old Macbook temp. Did a fine job. I installed it on the new MBP and the first thing I noticed was a dialogue saying that the software wasn't updated to support the new MBP yet but it should work. The readings I got were near double that of what I would get on my old Macbook; ambient and loaded. ~170 F or more loaded. 6300 rpm fan speed reported. At first glance this is OMGHAWT! But I suspect that there are a couple of reasons for this. I have no hard evidence I am simply offering my educated opinion having worked in the technical field for a number of years. First, the integrated graphics and the Processor are on the same die; they are physically one piece. As a result, the heat sink and fan system have to account for this with their footprint. The heat and fan speeds (and this is a stab in the dark based on other pieces of hardware Ive worked with) are reported via millivolt readings. The SMC fan software (probably) reports based on the millivolt readings. Given that this is the first generation MBP with Intel HD300 integrated graphic (again, different in many sharing respects than previous integrated systems), it is quite possible that the millivolt span changed and the reporting is skewed using the old span. As an example, assume the older macbooks had a span of 0-6mv; 0 being ambient and 6 being fully loaded.  The new macbookpros use a span of 0-10mv. Using the same reporting tool on both spans would result in incorrect readings in the 0-10mv example because at 6 the reporting tool would reflect maximum load temp and maximum fan rpm even though there were 4 more millivolts of span to use. Again, this is my guess.  TLDR version of cooling issues: The MBP after running team fortress2 for 1/2 hour does get warm around the power supply area and you can feel the heat coming from the exhaust ports. Macbooks do run warm and as I understand this is fairly well accepted; but not "we need a recall! its melting!" hot. Its typical in my opinion.  Anyway, I hope this helps people out there like me who were on the fence about what the bottom line is regarding performance and cooling of the item.  Love it love it love it.  ***Update 1/25/2012**** Just wanted to check back in and update my experience. Everything is fantastic with the machine. Its still my #1 prized possession. I added a hard clear snap on case, a screen protector film and a keyboard cover here from Amazon to protect my investment. The bottom got a few scratches on it from normal wear so I went ahead and decided to add armor. Some things I have done this year with it: 1) Manage my Linux server  -Really all I need is the command terminal, but OSX makes the working in terminal easypeasy. 2) Ive loaded Eclipse Europa and have written some programs in various languages. 3) Added Adium to unify my chat clients 4) Had a lot of fun with photo booth. 5) Got all my Itunes migrated over from My old windows machine and bought a bunch of new ones. 6) Played lots of WoW. 7) Bought Call of Duty Modern Warfare from the App store and am super pleased with the performance of the machine. 8) Bought an OEM copy of Windows 7 and loaded using Bootcamp.  -What a snap this was. The OSX disk that comes with machine doubles as a automatic drivers loader for Windows 7. Pop it in and it loads all the drivers and monitors when Apple releases updates. It runs Windows 7 as well as Windows 7 can run. Having gotten use to OSX, I honestly can't stand working in it unless I am forced to. I could go on but Ill leave it at that. 9) Bought Star Wars The Old Republic and have been playing on Windows 7 since early release. I get maybe 30fps on avg; dips down to 20 or so in super populated areas and reaches upper 50s at its best. I am very pleased with how it performs. Coming This Year -Upgrade to 16g ram; I think this is going to help with graphical performance given the nature of the shared memory architecture. -Try and really get down and dirty with iMovie, Time Machine, and some of the other applications that came with the machine that I haven't had a chance to use. -Interested to see where the thunderbolt/PCI video card ideas go. -Working on my Masters in CS and am I sure that I will have much fun and get an amazing amount of value out of this little guy.  Still 100% happy with it.	5.0	3.8276114463806152
Hard to say?  Let's jump right in. I have a u205 toshiba model a A215 AMD based Laptop same toshiba . For some reason the A205 model well while a good basic laptop better than Acer anyway .

DO NOT BUY FROM THIS BUYER!!  This company is complete garbage. They piece together used laptops poorly. I got this exact mac just over a year ago and is has completely crapped out and they won't respond to any of my messages. They had to replace one 2 weeks after I had it.

BEWARE OF THE SPACEBAR DEFECT  The product is good, handy and very portable. I like Linux and enables me to work on the go.  I don't want to give 5 stars because of a poor battery life and heating up.  I gave only 3 stars because this product has a spacebar defect which just upset me. Google for the spacebar defect. The key doesn't get pressed with the thumb, because it is slightly tilted on one side.  It is very disturbing when you open the case to see a defective product that you paid for. The flaw looks ugly as well from a visual perspective.	3.0	3.028944253921509

Should of done my research...  I bought this computer for school. I loved having a computer with me so I could type notes instead of write them. BUT the battery life on this computer COMPELETLY SUCKS. It seriously dies within 30 minutes of me having it fully charged. Needless to say it doesn;t last long at school for me unless I bring my charger, which is a pain because most of the seats at school are NOT near an outlet. Also, if the computer is on too long, it ovfer heats really easy and just turns off...lovely. Overall, not impressed.	2.0	2.054837703704834
Apple Hasn't Addressed Wireless Problem With This Laptop  My husband and I have been devoted Mac users for years and have owned at least 8 Apple computers and several Apple peripherals. Quite frankly I didn't think we would be writing any adverse review for any Apple product. But here I am doing just that and simply stated I would recommend that any of you considering this MacBook and who also rely heavily on wireless connectivity for your laptop to delay your purchase indefinitely until Apple has resolved an inherent wireless connectivity problem with OS 10.5.5.  I use this MacBook as my kitchen work station and rely completely on our wireless LAN (Apple Airport) as I have no ethernet port in the kitchen area of our house.  I am now experiencing numerous drop outs of both my internet connection and my LAN and this started after upgrading to Apple's OS 10.5.5 which appears to be the version that now comes installed on this laptop.  In reviewing numerous posts on Apple's "support" web-site it is clear that a significant population of other users of this same MacBook have the identical wireless connectivity problem with OS 10.5.5 and have been asking, pleading for help from Apple, e.g., that Apple fix their faulty software as in put it back through a full SQT. What we seem to have received is a Beta version they foisted on their customer base for debugging. I have yet to find anything on Apple's web-site offered by Apple that remotely addresses this problem.  Although otherwise this MacBook is an excellent performer, in this day and age there is an absolute need for reliable laptop wireless connectivity. Therefore we are very disappointed in this product's wireless performance as well as Apple's apparent lack of concern for their loyal customer base. After all, what good is a laptop with random wireless connectivity?  One day of this failure mode is one day too many and It is doubtful we will purchase another Apple computer until our confidence in their quality and customer responsiveness is restored. At the very least Apple should issue a statement admitting to the problem, indicating they are attempting to resolve the problem and specify a planned date for its resolution.  In the meantime buyer BEWARE of the Apple MacBook MB404LL/A 13.3-inch Laptop (2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 2 GB RAM, 250 GB Hard Drive) Black which is an expensive laptop that offers worthless wireless performance!!	1.0	0.9042774438858032
Not totally bad but....  I have beeen fixing one thses laptops for my cosin pretty much non stop.  I was interested to see a HP/Compaq hybrid after reading Compaq had been bought out by HP but I was expecting a much better notebook.  This note-book has horrible performance just like the old Compaq presario I used to have.  Had the same screen issues that my old Compaq had and also possesses the same horrible crashing that my old compaq had.  SO I guess HP just took the failed design of the old Compaq systems and re-shipped them.  This is proabally why just before they were bought by HP, Compaq had the lowest ratings and test scores of any brand it all catagories.  Not all Compaq's are bad, my releationship with the Compaq systems is they work or they don't, which I was no where near satisfied with.	2.0	1.962711215019226
The MacBook Pro is well built and there have been no problems with the hardware.  The software is another matter.  Yosemite is full of errors and does not work well with most web sites.  Numbers is Apple's spreadsheet, and costs only $20, but is not worth that much.  Also, you cannot sync an iPhone with Office for Mac.  With a MS system, this is easy.  Syncing all the features of an iPhone with a Mac requires using iCloud, which leaves you open to your private info being hacked.  Going to an Apple store and getting help is a hit and miss proposition.  Although I know people who have had good luck with the stores, all my experiences with the stores have been awful.  My recommendation is to avoid Apple computer products at all costs.	1.0	0.9033820629119873
Over promises and under delivers  After years of being a Windows user, I was ready for a change. I was fed up with constant crashes (probably didn't help that I was running Windows ME), viruses, Microsoft always adding new features without really fixing core problems, etc so after reading so much about Apple products I decided to switch. First, the good:  - My Mac (running on the latest Leopard OS) has a few pretty cool features.  Time machine (back up software for ALL your stuff on the Mac) seems pretty good (I've seen the demo but have never used it yet since you need an external hard drive)  - Spaces, that lets you divide your screen (specially useful if you are running lots of programs at the same time)  - Much less "malware", no viruses, far less "pop up" stuff or programs being installed without you knowing  - And being a novice user, that is pretty much it for now.  Now for the bad:  - First, you can buy much more with the same money if you decide to go with a Windows-based system. Macs are pricey  - Despite what you have heard on the news, Macs DO crash. In fact, my computer crashed TWO times just when I was thinking about writing a review  - If you are a MS Money software user (there's no Money for Macs) you will need to switch to Quicken. Listen to all the people in the forums and think twice about doing it. The switch was a NIGHTMARE. I probably spend 24 hours in a 3-week period to switch. Although this is not Apple's fault (Quicken is published by Intuit, which has nothing to do with Apple), the fact that there are far less programs for Apple than for Windows is a big issue  - You can't ready AVI (a movie format) files without a converter (you will need to pay for it to get a full version). I want to say there are at least a couple more movie formats that the Mac can't read  - The right click feature on the mouse pad is not straightforward. I recommend that you buy a mouse and program it to work with right click  - If you are subscribed to NetFlix you CAN'T yet (March 2008) watch movies on your Mac (has to do with Apple's Digital Rights Management software)  - Although there is a Mac version of Microsoft's Messenger, it does NOT support video. So if you want to have a video chat with a Windows' user, you will need to use either AOL's instant messaging program or Skype (video sessions between Mac users work very well in Apple's "ichat")  - Numbers, Apple's equivalent of Microsoft's Excel is a joke if you want to use it extensively. Numbers lacks many of Excel's advanced features  Overall, I am very disappointed with Apple. I was expecting almost a flawless experience, but even the basics sometimes are not covered (for example, the fact that my Mac crashes A LOT).	1.0	0.9097253084182739

CONVERTED  As a user of Microsoft based PCs for over 15 years (server administration), I was highly skeptical about how much different/better a MAC was as compared to a PC.  Boy was I shocked.  Boot time on my MacBook is almost none existant.  Every component I have connected via USB or Firewire (including a PSP, a Lyra MP3 player, 2 Motorola Cell phones, and a couple of DV camcorders) have been recognized and worked flawlessly without having to install drivers.  I was even able to sync the address book on my phone with the MAC Address Book via Bluetooth while using it as a GPRS modem to connect to the Internet via USB (which also charges the phone).  When I tried doing this with my previous laptop (Toshiba Tablet PC), it took me the better part of a day to get the drivers to work and even longer to get the PC to recognize the phone as a modem (not to mention to get it to work).  The bundled software in Mac OS-X 10.4 is extremely powerful and useful (not LITE versions, which are usually over glorified demos to get you purchase the full version).  Whether it is iChat, iMovie, or Garage Band, the software is easy to use and produces results. And the Help sections of everything ACTUALLY HELP.  All in all, my first experience with a Mac has been mind-blowing.  I can't believe it can do everything my old PC can do (usually faster).  My only complaint has been with Bluetooth.  It has Bluetooth 2.0 but does not support AVRCP or A2DP so that I can use my stereo bluetooth headphones to listen to iTunes.  However, I have been told that when OS-X 10.5 (Leopard) releases later this year, it will support both profiles.  Considering everything that this Mac does for me, I know this complaint sounds lame, but I wanted to be honest.  When I need to replace another laptop or PC (or buy one for my kids for school), the Mac line of laptops and desktops has just subplanted Microsoft-based PCs on the top (not to mention middle and bottom) of my list.	5.0	5.140883445739746
Cursor jumps around! poor tech support!  I bought this mini laptop two months ago for accessing my e-mail primarily. About a week ago, I installed Window Words XP onto this netbook because I need to take it to the library to do some research. I then discovered the cursor would jump to a different part of the document while I was typing, sometimes it would even highlight an entire paragraphy and then deleted it in a flash. It was extremely irritating, thank god there was the "UNDO" in the EDIT toolbar.  To make the story short, I called Toshiba Tech support three times and each time they told me how to fix it, and it failed: (1) Turn off the computer, unplugged the battery, hold the power button for 15 seconds to reset the computer; (2) To unistall the Window Words XP, then reinstall it; (3) To reformat the entire hard drive to factory setting. Of all the remedies, the last step was the most drastic and time-consuming because it took more than 2 hours to reformat the hard drive, plus however long it took to reinstall other softwares.  As I said earlier, none of the remedies recommended by the Toshiba Tech support worked. If you were near me after the hard drive was reformatted and the problem was still unsolved, you could see steam coming out of my head.  I then took the matter into my own hand, and did some research on the internet to find out what caused the cursor jumps around in laptop computers. Apparently, this is a very very common problem in a lot of laptops made by different brands. Some of it is related to hardware glitch, some of it is related to softwares, and some of it is related to something that is still not known.  For this netbook computer, because the keyboard is very small and the motion-sensitve touch pad is so nearby, it might pick up motions from keystrokes and cause the cursor to malfunction. I took the solution recommended by some bloggers who had this problem before: to turn off the touch pad completely, and plugged in a USB wireless mouse. Luckily, Window 7 has an option in the Control Panel/Hardware/Mouse/Advance which allows the users to disable the touch pad when a wireless mouse is plugged in. Guess what? the problem of the cursor jumped around stopped completely after I chose this option and plugged in a wirless mouse.  I then called Toshiba Tech Support, wanting to share this piece of information/solution with them. The supervisor, whom talked with a heavy latino accent, was extremely impatient and rude. For one thing, she kept mispronunced my name even after I corrected her each time, "all-ton" and not "owl-ton". Also, as I was about to tell her how I fixed the problem, she thanked me and wanted to terminated the conversation. I told her I wasn't finished, she then said something which was completely unrelated, "If you are unhappy about Toshiba products, I can authorize you a return to have our people fix your computer." I hanged up immediately, who needed to speak to Moron like that.  For those of you who want to buy this computer, think twice!!!! If you can put up with the cursor jumping around, and/or a Tech Support that is based at who knows where, go ahead!	2.0	0.9799770712852478
Awesome  This machine is awesome for its price! I bought it 2 weeks ago and Im very satisfied so far. Although the 1415-S173 features a Celeron, the lite chip from Intel, it has a full 256 KB of L2 cache so its performance nearly matches those of the far more expensive Pentium 4 chips (since until Northwood core arrived, P4s featured 256 KB L2 caches). Besides, the processor is a mobile battery-friendly chip. The laptops hard drive is pretty fast and spacious; its DVD/CDRW unit works flawlessly and is among the less noisy units Ive ever seen. It burns CDs at a 24X speed! DVD or DIVX reproduction is as smooth as a silk (not to mention DIVX encoding, is fast!). Ok, it has only 16 MB of video memory but those are real MB, not shared ones, so their performance is a way better if compared to most laptop graphics within the price range. Also, the graphics chip, which is what really makes the difference, is a speedy GeForce 4 Go 420! (NOT an ATI M6-C). This machine shines in games (they look gorgeous in its huge and bright 15 screen), even in some newer ones like NFS 6 or Unreal Tournament 2003 (maybe it doesnt matches the standards of high end desktop graphics of course, but those titles were still perfectly playable). My only complaint about this machine is its weight you should have strong shoulders if you want to carry it around. However, I still give it an A+	5.0	5.087249279022217

Terrible service, nice screen.  Don't buy.  Absolutely the worst, most frustrating tech support I have ever encountered. Any computer can have problems. To have to do 4 destructive recoveries, return the laptop twice for service and still have the same problems is unacceptable. Then to be assigned a case manager whose voice mail has no more space for messages is an insult. Finally they give you a phone number to call corporate. It is always busy. It has been 5 months of countless hours on hold and conflicting and uninformed instructions from barely intelligible "techies". DON'T BUY UNLESS YOU HAVE MASOCHISTIC TENDENCIES.	1.0	1.658191442489624

handy little computer  This little computer is exactly what it says it is: small, easy to carry around, and with limited capacity. It is very convenient for trips, where you want to keep up with email etc. via wifi at hotels and coffee shops, etc., but don't want to bring your regular computer along. The battery doesn't stay charged as long as might be nice, but that's not crucial. Also, as others have said, its small size results in a keyboard that's a little tricky to get used to. But that goes with the territory. In sum, it is cute and handy. And since it's fairly cheap, if something happens to it, it's not a huge loss.  Cate in Carolina	3.0	4.049997329711914
If you need a tablet pc this won't do the job!  Don't kid yourself! What you really want is the HP TX1440 tablet pc. And yes it's going to cost you 100% more. The big "no deal" item for the TX1210 was poor character recognition software. Pressing down on the screen and changing the pen to "medium" tip did not help.

The duo-core processer, base memory(2GB upgradable to 4GB),17inch screen and the Blu-ray player all features that will keep this laptop around for a while. Oh yeah and the duo hardrives that equal 320GB is a decent amount of space.	4.0	5.152564525604248
Nearly perfect!  I received my new iBook just over a month ago, and in that time, I've experienced very few problems - the ones that did pop up were extremely minor, and had more to do with the software than the computer itself. I ordered my iBook with 512 MB if RAM and 60 GB of hard drive space, and these extras are definitely worth the money since having only 30 GB could fill up very quickly. My only complaint about the iBook so far is the fact that it gets warm with extended use, making it somewhat uncomfortable for me to place directly on my lap or to touch for very long - but that aside, I'm enjoying my new laptop very much, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a new notebook computer. This is my very first laptop and I couldn't be any more pleased!	5.0	5.150640487670898
I bought this computer for my boyfriend and I was nervous because I read the reviews about the complications regarding the charger. I contacted the seller before hand my concerns and asked if they could ensure a working charger and indeed they did. The computer works just fine . Of course it has some scratches but nothing too bad. A good price. The shipping was quick  just was delayed  it was supposed to be here Saturday and didn't get here until Monday I ordered it Wednesday whatever reason but other than that good and quick communication. Thanks !  Update: This computer requires many updates which is very annoying. My boyfriend loves it though, having problems accessing FaceTime not sure why its not working, and the clicker is jammed. Other than that the computer works just fine	3.0	3.0080063343048096
Apple is Golden...  Without a doubt the best machine I have ever used. Typing away on it right now and it is simply incredible. The keyboard is brilliant. A hundred times more comfortable, at least for me, than the Macbook Pro keyboard. No two ways about it, this Macbook is a beauty. The display- gorgeous. Buy now, you won't regret it.	5.0	5.142216682434082
Compatibility Keyboard  Hi! I'm french and I would like to buy a MacBook soon. I usually write whith an AZERTY keyboard, and I think to know that US keyboards are QWERTY. Is it possible to change keyboard's language? On Apple website, we also can choose MacOs language. For example, in France we can choose MacOs French or MacOs International. What does it change? Thanks to you if you can help me.	5.0	4.023166656494141

Perfect for Students  Compared to the other Sony series, it is unbeatable. It has the perfect screen, keyboard, and weight. The S Series has too many cons including heat dissipation and the fan noise. If you want to buy a Sony laptop for a student or home use, get the FS660. The T Series is perfect for business but PLEASE stay away from the Sony S460. The S360 is better for heat reasons but lacks essential features such as dual-layer dvd burner.	5.0	4.417759418487549

Beware:  Invalid License  I bought one of these laptops two months ago. It has been working just fine. Today Microsoft told me that the license is not valid. It has a valid certificate of authenticity on the back but does not have a second "refurbished" CoA. When I look at the internal System Properties/General tab it says "XP Corporate" which means it was covered under a volume/site license which can not be transferred or sold. I will probably have to buy a fresh copy of XP ($150) and re-install.  Before I made the order I checked to see that the advertisement specified "Genuine Windows XP". I also checked the CoA when it arrived. When the Microsoft updater offered to run "Genuine Advantage" to check the authenticity I confidently thought "sure, go right ahead." Now every time I restart I get a big message that says I am a victim of software piracy. If left uncorrected, I expect the operating system would eventually simply stop running.  Some vendors specify "Genuine Windows XP".  If it arrives with XP it may be legitimate, or NOT.  Microsoft has a very active updating and authenticating program.  You probably don't want a system that is not kept up to date and free of security vulnerabilities.  The updater will check the system validity.	2.0	2.243600368499756

Love the computer, but its unusable out of the box  I purchased a computer and it arrived. Taking the machine out of the box, I was very pleased with the look and feel and design of the computer itself. However, after the computer booted up, I realized just how unusable this product was out of the box.  The machine comes with more trialware installed than any reasonable person should have to put up with. The software was so overrun with trialware that the machine crawled after booting up. All of the trialware started popping up dialogs asking me to update my software and and asking me to purchase full versions. The computer was utterly useless. I had to format the computer and put a clean version of Windows Vista on the box. However, this machine doesn't come with ANY disk -- not even a recovery disk. If you want a recovery disk, you have to pay for it.  The downside to that is, even if you had a recovery disk, you'd still end up installing all of the trialware again.  Sony did a great job with the computer, but their execution on the full user experience makes me rate this computer poorly.  Had Sony at least given me the ability to completely wipe the computer to a clean Vista install, I would have rated it a 2.  Had they simply supplied installation CDs for the trialware and shipped the clean machine without anything pre-installed,  I would have given this computer a 4 our of 5. Thanks for listening.	1.0	2.959812641143799

Do not buy this!!!  So i neglected to do research before purchasing this computer.  Boy was that a mistake.  It seemed like it would be a great notebook that had all the specs I needed.  It took about two hours before the screen went black the first.  I lost count at 25 times after that.  I took it back to Best Buy and they were very sympathetic to my dilema.  They gave me another one to take home and I thought my problems were solved...boy was I wrong.  The same thing happened again and I had to take it back. At this point I decided to buy a more expensinve HP instead and I have been more than satisfied.  Dont buy this computer unless you want a one headache after another.	1.0	0.9064107537269592
hard drive issues and snail speed wifi capabilities  I have bought refurbished laptops over my life and always got a solid laptop that lasts 1-2 years without protection. This time I figure since I don't need more than 100gb hard drive I'll save a couple extra bucks and go with 80Gb. I decide to install Kaspersky internet security (which I highly recommend you buy for any computer)  because I want it to last. Okay, protected good I think now to install Itunes, online games , and the program for my homework. None will install... Error message hardrive full. Okay delete stuff like pictures that come preloaded and things I won't use. Again error message the same one hard drive full. yes I know I'm trying to free up space. try to delete different stuff... ERROR HARD DRIVE FULL. What does that mean?  Obviously this is unlikely to happen to you most refurbished laptops are great but besides that this one has other problems. Java not installed when you recieve normally not a big deal but I had that problem where I couldn't put anything besides Kaspersky. Internet is slow running, and I have superb wifi. If I can't fix and my dad can't either this is going back before I'm stuck with it.	2.0	2.6724140644073486
No longer the best in its class but it's a good stuff  As power users wait patiently for PowerBook G5, Apple gives us the most matured PowerBook G4 to date.  No major breakthrough here, but all are nice to have:  - Faster CPU: 7447A running 1.5 GHz vs. 7447 running 1.25 GHz  - Faster GPU: ATI Mobility RADEON 9700 vs. ATI Mobility RADEON 9600  - Faster SuperDrive: writes CD-RW, DVD-R, and DVD-RW at double the speed  - $100 cheaper  - Fixed various manufacturing defects that plagued previous generation (e.g., bad LCD)  All in all, these additions make up the fastest and most trouble-free PowerBook G4.  Still... there are things missing:  - Long battery life: although Apple specifies 4.5 hours of battery life, you will be lucky to get 3 (most will get 2 to 2.5 hours under typical use)  - Faster hard disk: although you can specify 5400 RPM hard disk as built-to-order option, it bundles 4200 RPM hard disk (not optimal for GarageBand and iMovie)  - High resolution LCD: year after year, the 15-inch PowerBook is still stuck at 15.2" running 1280x854 resolution; Apple should offer higher resolution 15.4" as an option for power users  - New Bluetooth 1.2: it includes older Bluetooth 1.1  - No digital audio output: most notebooks don't yet offer this, but Apple should  - Slower in most respect than high-end Centrino notebooks  If you need the best portable running Mac OS X today, this 15-inch PowerBook is it (unless you can comfortably carry 17-inch). But I wonder what Apple has it in store for the PowerBook G5 next year.	4.0	4.050410270690918

Great laptop  It has been nearly 10 years since my last Macintosh purchase.  I have been using windows based PCs because of my job requirements.  I cannot believe how much better the apple product is than the others I have used.  It does everything automatic and quickly.  I was shocked at how easy it was to set up on my home and work networks.  When I was setting up, I got frustrated because I could not figure out how to setup the computer for my network.  While I was looking through the control panels, I get a message that updates were ready to be installed.  It did everything on its own!  For the three PC's I own I had to call support from my ISP and had to use all kinds of back door tricks to get it to work.  I am very pleased at how fast it operates both on battery and plugged in.  My PC laptop drags to a crawl when on battery.  The computer starts up in a few seconds (a large improvement over the past Macs that I have owned).  At this point, I hardly use my wintel based PCs.  It is nice to return to Macintosh!	5.0	4.110345840454102
Broken Product  I got the item in the time limit, but only five of the keys work on the keyboard. And the ones that do work do something entirely different than what it's supposed to do. I'm completely disappointed and livid about this whole issue. The seller is slow at communication and their number on their site doesn't work which makes it even harder to contact them. They've shaken my feelings toward Amazon, which is sad since I've used this site for years. All in all, a poor purchase that was a huge mistake!!!	1.0	0.9045002460479736

Excellent unit, but suffers minor failures often  (a) Best keyboard ever made for laptops, (b) Decent speed, runs Office 2007 O.k., (c) Acceptable graphics (ATI 7500) or good graphics (ATI 9000 / 9600 / FireGL, the latter 2 can play Far Cry 1.0), (d) Thinklight is very useful on overseas plane flights, (e) fits perfectly on all airplane tray tables, (f) Outstanding battery life with CD-battery + 9-cell (5-6 hrs if you dim the screen), (g) It actually sleeps and wakes up properly unlike 50% of all laptops, and (h) You can just grab it and run to a conference room, yanking it out of the minidock, and it will sleep properly, unlike newer (T60, T400) machines where you have to hit a key first !!  DONT buy anything with less than 1.8 Ghz processor as the 1.7 Ghz and lower have a smaller cache(2MB vs 3MB) and are about 33% slower.  I have used about 4x of these machines at work over the past 6 years.  I just got my 4th machine so each machine lasts about 2 years.  The typical failure is a really bad/sticky key (1st), a failure of some buttons on the synaptics track pad (2nd), a hard drive failure (3rd), or a failure of the power-port male plug, making it difficult (but not impossible) to charge the unit.  With the exception of the hard drive failure, NONE of the failures were catastrophic "I cannot do any work right now" type of failures, so the system is robust.  The IBM repair manual is fantastic so I buy new parts on ebay and repair it myself.  I've replaced hinges(very hard), screens(very hard), keyboard(easy), touchpad(easy), fans(medium - you need CPU paste).  The keyboard in particular takes 120 seconds to replace as it's just 5 screws and it pops out.	5.0	2.9449167251586914

Best Price - Quality ratio ever  I was thinking about buying a mac for a long time. Finally after many discussions with collegues and friends I bought this computer.. and now I have just one word: Awesome.  - Everything on this computer is very well designed (good looking and functionabillity).  - It is very easy to use, and very reliable. Software is easy to install, and due to the OS (osX) is based on linux, applications rarely crashes (I had just one crash in 1 month).  I really love it, and I've seen that many scientists use this computer (or Power book) for stabillity reason.  I recomend it.. the osX is far ahead from windows.	5.0	5.145429611206055

VGNSZ770N a mixed bag (XP Downgrade, Camera, Antenna, Battery)  I have had this laptop for a month, and these are my experiences: Upon opening, I attempted to use the included XP Downgrade disc, but it was faulty (apparently not an uncommon problem). While support sent me another disc, I used Vista and decided it was okay but not good enough. When the replacement XP downgrade disc arrived, it worked. The webcam didn't work though. Many frustrating calls and chat sessions (Sony chat support is better than phone support), they said I needed a fresh install. So I installed XP Downgrade again, and it still didn't work. As it turns out, several drivers were not working with a fresh install and they had to be downloaded from Sony. After that, the webcam works, though the framerate is not as high as on Vista (15fps on XP). XP is quite a bit faster than Vista on this computer (not surprising).  The antenna attached to the notebook is cheap and flimsy. In the hustle of the airport, I put the laptop back in my bag, and the antenna got caught on the side of my bag and is now bent. I wish there were a way to take it off as I don't need the WWAN.  The battery (like other users attest) loses power even if the whole system is turned off. This is annoying as I do not use my laptop every day during the summer (I am a student), opting for the convenience of my desktop quite often. Therefore, I have to worry about my battery much more than I did with my previous laptop, which was a Gateway. I'm not sure by how much it loses power as I have only recently realized it has this problem, but it's ~10% per day. I have not attempted to contact Sony regarding the battery due to other reviews which make it seem futile.  In the end, this laptop is pretty cool. It looks nice, runs fast, says Sony on it, the keys make a satisfying click for fun typing, the screen is pretty, etc. However, I wish it had a slot-load disc drive, more USB ports, a backlit keyboard, better battery which didn't drain even when powered off, and a sturdier and removable WWAN antenna.	3.0	3.0176498889923096
Good H/W lousy software  I bought this laptop because I wanted something that is relatively light-weight but still has a decent size display and is fast. No complaints on this side. There are certain things that you should know though - 1. VISTA and other software loaded on this machine sucks. Even though this machine has 2Gig RAM it is not fast because of all this stupid out of box software setup. I wanted to install XP Professional on this but that turned out to be a big pain. I still haven't been able to do this inspite of having purchased a legal copy of XP. Nothing specific to this machine but you should know. 2. The mobile networking is not very stable. Every so often I lose internet connectivity and am reduced to local connectivity on the wireless modem. This doesnt happen with other machines on the same wireless network. Dont know the reason yet. 3. Display is really good and keyboard is also very smooth. 4. Battery life is not so long - have not measured it but seems short lived. Inspite of all this, I love the machne.	3.0	3.012937307357788
Where's the Model number?  I've only had mine for a week and aside from allowing VISTA to drive me up a wall it seems to be a rather sound laptop.  Though people claim it does not have a lot of extras on it I find it offers more than I will use in a life time.  I'm a litle disappointed in battery life but what is bugging me is WHERE IS THE MODEL NUMBER???  I can find it no where on the PC.  How do I even know this is the model that I purchased.  I find this very intersting.  But again its a good machine.	4.0	4.046034812927246

Another Great Notebook from Sony  Well, like Kurt Lieber below, who actually HAS this computer too, there are somethings which I like and do not like.  Pros:  1. This computer is very stylish. It is a comprehensive package which includes many features that you'd expect to see from a computer of this price...well most. It's in a great form-factor and has the best color combo. Even the seemingly out-of-place silver touchpad somehow matches with the entire package.  2. The carbon-fiber casing of this computer makes this a very light computer. Plus it one-ups the non-premium model with a higher quality look.  3. Sony's white LED backlit LCD WXGA X-Brite Display...WOW!!! (only a very very limited amount of notebooks have this LED backlit feature). you have never seen true white until you use this computer. I came from a Vaio S260 with X-Brite and this successor just blows it out of the ballpark.  4. Integrated fingerprint reader is easy to use and saves time when you don't keep track of all the different usernames and passwords you have.  5. Hybrid graphics. Although you have to restart the computer to switch, this is a very good idea to keep battery life high, and keep efficient computing.  6. Sony makes the best keyboards from the best materials; it's not like the cheap plastics from other manufacturers. It has a long stroke and they are full-size. And they make the most precisely engineered tap sounds.  7. Hidden [num lock] [caps lock] [scroll lock] indicator lights.  8. Smooth back display cover, unlike the rough finger-file cover on the non-premiums.  9. QUALITY! made in Japan...you're not going to find another computer that has the aesthetics of Sony Vaios.  Cons:  1. I don't like the triangular design. It is .9" in the front and 1.3" in the rear. The actual front is less than .9" because the casing two tiered. so it's even thinner when grabbing from the front.  2. The cassettes to fill the PC-card and Express-card slots...What happened to the flaps? like in the Vaio S?  3. The integrated camera is pretty awful, unless i just don't know how to program the fuzzy picture out.  4. There is a lot of pre-installed software on this computer. When it first came out-of-the-box, there was about 120GB left. Then somehow, it kept getting lower and lower, and i wasn't even doing anything. I have no idea how I lost 25 MORE GB by the next day.  5. The fingerprint reader takes the space of the mouse buttons, making the buttons really small.  6. Wireless toggle turns on and off the wireless connections...but why must it be linked to the Bluetooth? You can only turn off Bluetooth if you turn off ALL wireless connections.	5.0	5.123578071594238

Over-Priced, Clunky Screen, Way Too Heavy  Those three problems are my complaints of this product.  And it's quite likely that I will never purchase an apple laptop again after over 20 years of "apple only / mac addict / cult of mac".  I realized apple really is a cult of sorts and few of its products are worth even half their cost.  Specically of this product it was just heinously expensive.  People immersed in apple culture forget that 2 grand for a laptop is absurd.  You could get the most cutting-edge top of the line desktop pc for the same amount.  The Screen.  I do work with laptop resting up on knees while laying in bed at times, this screen clumsily doesn't stay up and collapse forward sometimes causing you to have to prop it up!  Finally, I lugged this behemoth piece of rubbish to two continents and it was basically a 6 pound brick I carried in my bags because of such short battery life and heavy physical weight.  The CPU performance is okay, but I'm not interested in apple OS anymore.  That anti-apple rant said, I do think their music products (like the shuffle and ipod touch) are very practically priced and lightweight and don't suffer from these problems (although the app store is too insular).  The ipad seems like a clunky-overpriced piece of rubbish as well.  So basically, I'm only likely buying apple music hardware products if any apple products from now on.  I realized what I was paying for was "cult membership", something I that doesn't interest me.  But that's a bit of a tirade, the main issues were INSANELY over-priced, collapsing screen, physically heavy, and dismal battery life.  I do not recommend this product unless you keep it on a desk and never travel with it, but then why spend money on a laptop?  This clunky piece of junk's software operates fine but if it's a massive burden on the pocketbook and travel's back, causing weight and battery and screen hassles, it's definitely not worth it and not a likeable product at all.	2.0	1.970571756362915

Stay far, far away.  I was extremely disappointed with this laptop. Brand new, it had multiple problems - it froze at random and sometimes needed a great deal of coaxing to wake up from sleep. (Opening and closing it a number of times. The touchpad is pretty wide and it isn't set in deep enough, so it's easy to constantly be moving the mouse pointer when you're typing, which isn't horrible but is rather distracting. HP's customer service, in the four calls I was forced to make to them, kept me on the phone for hours each time and was completely unable to make any headway on my problem. (On the bright side, I suppose the problem isn't terribly common, since I could only find a few references online.) After my cheap old eMachines laptop is still chugging away after four years despite the abuse I've heaped on it, I was extremely disappointed. HP's awful, awful customer service alone is good enough reason for me to avoid them from here on out.	1.0	0.9037299752235413
SCAM:  What arrived is not what I ordered, paperwork reveals SCAM  Ordered this laptop and what arrived was a T61 7648:  2.0GHz CPU instead of the advertized 2.2GHz; no fingerprint scanner; 12.1" standard def screen screen instead of a 14.1" widescreen; fewer port options;  etc etc etc.  Now this is the part you need to pay attention to here:  The features listed here in this advertisement matched the paper that shipped with the laptop.  However, the features on the advertisement and paper did NOT match the features of the laptop I actually received.  Now pay attention here:  the SERIAL NUMBERS (paper and on device) MATCHED.  I repeat:  The features of the laptop received did not match the features on the paper/advertisement BUT THE SERIAL NUMBERS ON THE PAPER AND ON THE LAPTOP STILL MATCHED.  This means I have been SCAMMED.  Amazon being notified.	1.0	1.9703853130340576

Ultraportable laptop for under $400-great for students and travelers  I bought mine back in October. I waited for months for it to be released in the US, and I researched and read reviews from every possible source. I was tired of lugging around my Dell Inspiron laptop that weighed around 6.5 pounds. That plus books, makeup bag, and general things I carry every day made my bag way too heavy on days I had classes. And I really need to carry a laptop to classes. Without typed notes, forget about studying. I can't read my own writing. The Eee is super light--lighter than many books I have to read for classes. I almost immediately loaded XP on it, which created some problems of space, but I dumped a bunch of useless stuff, and the speed returned. There's no hard drive; it uses flash memory. I keep any nonessential programs on one flash drive, and all documents on a second flash drive. The Eee turns on and shuts off more quickly than my Dell ever did, even when it was new, which is very convenient in school. When I'm running Word and using the Internet, one class (2 hours) gets the battery down to 30%, but I try to sit near a plug whenever possible. I sometimes have problems when the Atheros and Windows programs fight for the wireless connection, so neither connects, but I can usually fix it. The tiny screen size is my biggest gripe. A good proportion of the screen space is taken by the speakers, a really dumb design idea. The new Eee 900 fixes this flaw for $149 more. Not enough of an issue for me to spend that much for a new one, but maybe a reason for someone to get the 900 over this one. Built-in webcam is great! I can fit the Eee in my purse and it's barely heavier than a paperback. Everyone who sees me using it has to come over for a look, even our IS people (Good way to meet people). My husband is a big guy and has large hands and he HATES the tiny keyboard. I don't have many problems typing (and I don't know how to touch-type), except I often hit the caps lock key. I love my Eee. For a gift, I would buy someone the Eee 900 with the larger view-screen.	4.0	4.006048202514648
If you need something mobile, cheap, and versatile  I've been using the 4G Black eee PC for about a month now.  Initially, I had a lot of concerns about the size of the monitor and the keyboard, but I'm glad to say that all of these concerns have been relieved!  If you have large hands, please don't get this laptop; the keys are small, but for average sized hands, you will probably get used to the size rather quickly. Furthermore, the keyboard has a nice amount of spring to it.  I've been very pleased with this purchase.  The laptop is extremely small and is about the size of a thick planner. Bootup takes only a few seconds.  Furthermore, the eee is extremely functional.  I haven't had any problems or felt any limitations with web-browsing, using openoffice programs, running email client, using Skype; there are a good set of programs already on the machine, but with the eee forums available, you can pretty much install whatever you may need.  One feature that I've been particularly taking advantage of is the ability to resize the windows of programs to exceed the area bound by the monitor and then to move the window around by holding alt and dragging the window with the mouse.  The speakers on the eee are surprisingly good.  I have noticed some minor things that I wish would be remedied.  First, charging the battery is extremely slow.  Second, placing the computer on standby is completely not worth the power trade-off; the machine consumes too much of the battery during standby (although with the fast bootup, this really isn't a big deal).  Third, the touchpad can be unresponsive at times.  Also, it can be too small at times.  But this can be easily fixed with a separate mouse.	4.0	4.042477130889893
1030 us dv2 Pavilion Not what it says it is :(  I read the reviews , and it seemed the idea thing to buy as I have had HP before... says it sings and dances !!! When you get it, it is not what you think, it has a design fault, do not plug in all the usb ports as then it goes as slow as a snail the new AMD Athlon chip Neo 64 overloads and runs far to slow Shame it does not do what one thinks .... you only get what you pay for so spend a bit more and buy a faster machine is my advice	2.0	0.9372988939285278

still needs refurbishing  I recieved my refurbished laptop and was surprised on what good shape it was in and was impressed only to have it 2 weeks before problems started, the screen went dark and would not work for about a week, then it mysteriously started working again however battery light continues to flash daily, now i often find the screen now turns white when i turn it on, if i had to do over i would have bought new instead of paying less for something that half the time doesn't work!	2.0	1.978926181793213
WAIT FOR WINDOWS 7, VISTA IS REALLY BAD  This is a great laptop, but unfortunately Vista is a real bad Operating System.  I have several conflicts trying to run my old software in Vista, so you must upgrade all your programs to work or try to work in Vista. I bought this laptop to replace a desktop.  It is a power laptop, but it is also heavy and consume energy so your battery will last for less than 2 hours, but it works fine for me because I was replacing a desktop. Again, it is a Good laptop, but WAIT for a new Operating system that will be released in October or November this year.  If you buy your laptop now, no one will support your migration to the new operating system.	3.0	3.00685453414917
Nice Laptop, not great, just nice.  Received my DV9750US yesterday. It's got some good features, big bright screen, even when running on battery power. If you know how to set the power settings in Vista. It came with 3GB memory, I wanted 4GB. Stick with the 3GB unless you are running a 64 bit OS. Laptop seems to be plenty fast enough, but I have not installed my Apps yet. Boots up fast and shuts down fast.  Only three stars for the following reasons:  HP's Quickplay does not display in full screen, or at least I have not found the control yet.  Mine came with a Blue-Ray drive, waste of money because it would not play on my  HD LCD TV via the built in HDMI port. Why have a HDMI output and HD DVD player if you can't watch a movie in full screen mode (Blue-Ray only plays with HP's Quickplay software) I would have gotten the model with a HD drive and 2.2 GHZ DC had I known that.  Next is the keyboard, the 'Shift' Key seem too small, or the 'Enter' Key is too big. Takes getting used to.  This model also came with two 250GB hard drives, one for the OS and one for Data. I have not seen any RAID options which would have been nice to have.  I would give the DV9750US 4 or 4 1/2 stars, but the Blue-Ray limitations or QuickPlay limitation just pissed me off. Other than that and no RAID, this may prove to be the best laptop I've had. I'll still buy another one, without the Blue-Ray drive.  Good but not Great.	3.0	3.000284194946289

Grade B+  Overall I am happy with the MacBookPro.  Lots of positives.  Problems include 1)too hot to handle, uncomfortably hot when used as a laptop.  2)Kept shutting down after a few minutes of battery use.  I took it to the Apple store and a new battery seem to have solve the problem. 3)The lid/screen is slightly warped, this is more cosmetic.  I bought this notebook in March 2006.  I believe that I bought too early.  I have an Imac which is awesome, and receives an A+.	4.0	3.9742205142974854

not bad, not great  A pretty decent powerhouse laptop for the price, but because of the low price point if has very little software.  It's loaded with 'samples' and 'trials' that I deleted pretty much immediately.  Loading itunes was difficult for some reason.  I had to load it three times, and finally got it load after uninstalling quicktime.  Now it appears to be fine.  I have heard that toshiba laptops have this problem.  I will say that I had heard both good and bad about vista before purchasing, and wasn't really concerned and I've gone through this several times before with everyone running around saying "windows 95 sucks, windows 98 sucks, windows xp sucks".  If I had to do over, I would custom order a laptop without vista.  Vista actually does appear to suck.  It is not intuitive, and I cannot do the most simple task such as "save as" without jumping through hoops and much cursing.  I just opened an excell spreadsheet I carry with me on a usb drive and it would not allow me to save it to the computer.  I suppose as I learn it my opinion may change about Vista, but for jumping in and working with it immediately, it is a bit tough.  Heck, they even hid the shut-down button in a most inconspicuous place. The one real negative besides the OS, which is not toshiba's fault, is the horrendously short battery life.  Carry your power cables with you, you'll need them.  You get maybe...just maybe two hours of life at what I would call low level usage.  It's on and I'm surfing.  Heaven forbid I actually use the dvd drive and really shorten that battery life. Screen display and size is fine, built in pointing is okay, but Acer's little scroll button is way better than the toshiba's nothing, you'll need a mouse for anything beyond basic goofing off. I'm not really too disappointed in it, but it didn't impress me as much as I thought it would, even with the pretty decent price.  New add on 5-3-08:  I've had this for a whle now and while I've gotten used to vista (used to and liking it are not the same..but it actually does appear to be incredibly stable)  but the ONLY thing that I would really change is the pointing device.  But to be honest, I carry the power cables and a mouse with it at all times, and the mouse comes out for anything I deem 'serious' computer usage.  New add on 9-26-08:  dvd player/burner is toast, and I hardly ever used it.  I don't watch movies on this thing, so the inconvenience factor is low, but I occasionally burn stuff so I bought a dual layer external with lightscribe.	3.0	3.0116372108459473

Horrible  Display Glare, SLOW CD  Oh the display is so bright especially when it REFLECTS glare from sunlight and interior lights so much compared to other displays.  It will also be hard to keep the screen clean because of the glossy surface. I Have 3 words to say about the display GLARE,GlARE and Glare.  Its like those projection TV's with shiny plastic screens.  But it does work in dim rooms good.  Also copying cd's to the harddrive is HIDEOUSLY SLOW!!!.  In fact, I had trouble reading homemade CD's that were easily read on other computers.  I ended up having to use an IOMEGA external USB cdburner/writer to copy those cd's onto my vaio. Im not sure if its the harddrive or the CD player, but my desktop computer is so much faster in copying files.  everything else seems to be ok though.  I wish the touchpad was bigger like in competing brands.  This is a low-end Sony, it compares to the compaqs and toshibas that go for 900-1100 dollars.  You pay a premium to have the name Sony on the computer.	3.0	3.0011050701141357

Best laptop I ever owned  Well after dealing with Vista for the past few months I gave in and purchased a Mac for the 1st time ever.  Wow!!! What a difference.

Wish it came with the faster hard drive.  I am very happy with this Toshiba laptop but I wish it came with the faster hard drive. The 5400 rpm drive is plenty fast enough for our use but for the price I would have liked a 7200 drive.  It gets fairly rough use by several people at our international folk dances. Our Mit_Player Database of 2500 MP3 songs is accessed by our dancers who pick the folk song they need and then play it out of the Toshiba into our amp and speakers.  The small 4 pound weight makes it easier for us to take home for security and where we make updates to the database. It will also be taken to dance events in other states and Canada.	4.0	4.088463306427002
Good value for the money- but with some tradeoffs  I have been using the C140G for a few weeks now.  The biggest pain out of the box was all the additional  trialware and other Sony proprietary programs.  The laptop is running much better after a clean up and install of common  open source stuff- (firefox, thunderbird, vlc, audacity, etc)  A good bonus was that I had an old extra capacity battery  from an old Vaio that was compatible with the C140G.  The laptop does not come with Gigabit Ethernet (1000mps)-  which was surprising considering it is positioned as a  multimedia laptop.  Gigabit Ethernet *is* available on the docking station- but  that will set you back another $200.00  For the CPU- it is a great 64 bit core 2 CPU (I have a full 64 bit  linux distro running on another partition) - BUT I wish I would  have checked the processor version more closely.  The 5500 Core 2 CPU does not support virtualization (VT)- so I can't run  some of my 64 bit VMWARE virtual machines while booted in XP.  The 5600 Core 2 and the 7XXX series do support the VT feature so  I miss this feature.  Overall - the laptop has a nice form factor and good value for the money.	4.0	3.211366891860962
A winner  A good companion with the white or black iPods, I believe that Apple has finally come out with an attractive and attractively priced portable - that means business. Several features will surprise Mac fans:  - Although it's only 13.3 inches, the clairty and brightness of the screen makes for easy viewing. It's easy to watch for long periods of time withoutt straining.  - The black version (which comes at a slightly higher price) is particularly striking, though all the current configurations have that shiny screen many have been requestiong for so long.  - This has a very respectable speed, though maxing out the RAM will really give you the opportunity to enjoy the machine at its best.  - Although this laptop has some real power under the hood, heat build-up surprisingly wasn't an issue, even with long sessions. In fact, a long-standing  problem seems to have been solved - that of cursor skittishness caused by heat. I found tracking very smooth under all conditions.  - One should be careful wtih the hinge on the MacBook; as long as lift the screen from the edges, you'll have no problems at all.  - The black version can accumuulate visible "greasiness" on the pad, if that's an issue for you. I haven't noticed the same for the white version.  Apple has a winner with this one, no question.	5.0	5.149813175201416

Fear ASUS like The Plague  This laptop arrived without a recovery DVD, and without a recovery partition from which to generate one.  The recovery partition it was supposed to have was missing altogether.  Essentially, this means that I got a single-use copy of Windows 7 Home Premium.  If anything should happen to this install, I either need to find a burnable copy of windows 7, or purchase another retail copy.  Not very nice, ASUS.  I've bought things from ASUS in the past brand new, that were perfect and as-advertised.  This refurbished item will be the LAST thing I'll be buying from ASUS.  EDIT: Here's the actual support email chain when I inquired about the missing recovery partition, to give you an idea of how absolutely useless ASUS support is.  The punchline of it all is when the support rep writes "But I think it is impossible for an asus laptop has not support disks or hidden partition".  You think it's impossible?  You want me to shell out more money for support discs?  No thanks.  Experience the tragedy:  ========  My laptop arrived today without a recovery partition or a recovery DVD, making it impossible to back up or restore the laptop's default configuration. Please provide me with a URL where I can download a recovery image, or send me a recovery disc post-haste, as this was to be a gift for a non-technical person.  ========  Dear valued customer, Thank you for contacting ASUS Customer Service.  Hi, there is a hidden partition in the machine for os recovery. Please use AIrecovery do backup it into DVD disks.  Method Two Using Recovery DVD (on selected models) Creating the Recovery DVD: 1. Double-click the AI Recovery Burner icon on the Window desktop. 2. Insert a blank writable DVD into the optical drive and click Start to start creating the Recovery DVD. 3. Follow the onscreen instructions to complete creating the recovery DVD. Prepare enough blank writable DVDs as instructed to create the Recovery DVD. IMPORTANT! Remove the external hard disk drive before performing system recovery on your Notebook PC. According to Microsoft, you may lose important data because of setting up Windows on the wrong disk drive or formatting the incorrect drive partition.  Using the Recovery DVD: 1. Insert the Recovery DVD into the optical drive. Your Notebook PC needs to be powered ON. 2. Restart the laptop. Press ESC when you see ASUS logo and then select the optical drive (may be labeled as "CD/DVD") from ODD. Press [Enter] to boot from the Recovery DVD. 3. Select OK to start to restore the image. 4.

Not Impressed!!!  I actually bought this product as part of a research report I am currently writing at work, and have been using it just to see the differences between Mas OS and Vista.  Do the difference is: MAC OS X SUCKS!!!!!!!  After a month, I am still not used to it (granted I did start using it less and less) and its aesthetic features are far inferior to aeros on vista (also, it crashes a lot more, I guess that not published because of Mac's smaller user base)  Anyways, there is nothing wrong with this lap top and you can definitely buy and install vista which would already make this lap top 9348023948 times better. Nevertheless, you need to take the price into consideration. You can get a dell, HP, or sony vaio for far cheaper but with the same specs.  Better yet, get yourself a laptop that has 2GB of memory (this model has 1, and adding another GB costs even more) so that you can run any operating system you choose smoothly and beautifully.  Anyways, just keep in mind three things before you buy this: 1 Bad user interface is very confusing and very impractical, especially for those who have grown up using windows (basically everybody)  2 Extremely overpriced - can get a much better laptop for same money  3 Not compatible with many of your favorite games and other software applications	1.0	0.9048205614089966

Sleep mode useless  There's plenty of good features to this laptop as you can see from the other reviews.  It has, however two flaws that you should know about:  1. the right shift key is in a non standard place 2. the sleep mode is basically useless - the laptop uses too much energy when it's in sleep mode so it will shutdown (without closing programs) in just a few hours.  the shift key issue can be fixed - google asus eee users forum for details the sleep mode problem is a deal breaker for me.	2.0	1.9902688264846802

Sleek appearance, but has room for improvement; loss of some basic features  For my review I am going to organize this into positive and negative aspects of this new model based on my experience with both the old and new models, as well as a general understanding of what is available at this price point from PC manufactures (Dell, Sony, HP):  Pros: 1. LED screen, brighter, better battery life, better for the environment (no mercury). 2. 1066MHz frontside bus. 3. ~8x Better graphics performance than previous model. 4. Easy access to hard drive. 5. Half-pound lighter than previous model.  Cons: 1. No Firewire port. This means no target disk mode, or using minidv decks/cameras which require firewire. I feel this is a poor decision on Apple's part. This makes two of my hard drives useless without an adapter of some kind. One FW800 port would have been nice, and from an engineering point of view, they could have fit it in there. 3. No HDMI port (yet to see this on a mac). 4. No eSATA port (yet to see this on a mac). 5. 5400 rpm hard drive. Better HDD performance requires $700 SSD upgrade on Apple's site. 7200rpm drive is something a tech savvy user can install themselves, though. 6. Price. Base model is $1299. 7. $1299 model does not have backlit keyboard. $800 Dell laptops have this. 8. Display appears to have poorer contrast and viewing angles than previous model, even when using a Spyder calibration device. Also display is only available in glossy which some consumers do not like.  Other points consumers should be aware of: 1. Aluminum body; better displacement of heat than previous model, but body may dent easier. 2. Button-less trackpad, people will have to retrain their muscle memory, but is rather easy to get used to. 3. Display port replaces mini DVI port, but at least they have new adapters to DVI and VGA.  Overall: I am generally neutral on this redesign. Very pleased with graphics upgrade, but equally disappointed by lack of ports, poor LCD display, and glossy only option. Bottom line, I can get a Dell Latitude for $800 with eSATA and Firewire--but, of course, it can't run Mac OSX.	3.0	2.8418846130371094

I wanted what they advertised, not what they actually shipped.  Be very careful when ordering one of these; Asus has been changing the spec on the 4G without notifying vendors such as Amazon. I ordered and returned two units to Amazon that were missing the mini-pcie expansion connector in the expansion bay, and a third unit that I inspected at a local store was missing the expansion bay entirely, so I couldn't even upgrade the memory. The units that are shipping, unlike the units that have been reviewed all over the web, are NOT EXPANDABLE.	1.0	0.9041842222213745

Think Twice re T115D-S1120  We bought a Toshiba T115D-S1120 for our son entering middle school.  We have had it 5 months.  I passed on a notebook because I wanted a little bigger screen.  The larger screen size is definitely better.  As a PC, it generally works fine.  3 issues.  1) It overheats sometimes when it has been used for several hours and behaves erratically.  It has to cool for two hours before it can be used again.  2) The wireless drops all the time, so internet has become nearly useless.  Since my son needs to access his school almost daily, this is a real issue.  3)  I leaned towards Toshiba's disk lock feature thinking this would be valuable for rough-and-tumble boy.  But, the disk lock engages with the slightest movement, including bumping the table.  So, even when I use it carefully, it locks, and I have to click to an OK button to get it going again.  I was going to rate this a 3, but as I wrote this and recalled all our frustrations, I changed it to a 2.  By the way, my daughter's ASUS notebook, which was bought at the same time, works like a charm.  It  hasn't given us even the slightest issue.  We also have had 10 different laptops over the years from 8 manufacturers, so we have a good idea what to expect from a laptop.  This one has been the most problematic.	2.0	2.107869863510132
Good Paper Weight...  The computer did not turn on when it was received. I figured that the battery was dead so I plugged the power cord into it. When I attempted to turn it on again, the led indicators flashed once and that was it. Any other attempts did just that. I noticed that the power cord wasn't even any good as the indicator light on it did not turn on so I brought the laptop to a local shop. They plugged in a working power cord and still the same thing. I was told the motherboard was most likely dead. I also took a look at the RAM and noticed there was only 512 MB instead of the advertised 1GB. Overall, nothing was as it was supposed to be. Laptop was supposed to be "refurbished" but instead was nothing short of "used".  I will say that there were no problems with sending the product back.  If you decide to buy one of these, be sure to check that you get what was advertised!	1.0	0.9051542282104492
A work of art...  When you are buying a Picasso, you can't expect to pay discount. The Powerbook G4 is a premium computer, and you pay a premium price. What you get puts competing PC-based products to shame, except, alas, on price. The biggest advantage of the PBG4 -- besides, of course, the operating system -- is design efficiency and elegance. Despite having a 15.2-inch screen and a fast processor (one optimized for intensive video applications and presentations), the PBG4 weighs just 5.6 pounds and is stunningly slim at 1-inch thick. Check your average ad for similarly equipped laptops and they simply can not compare. Take Sony's VAIO GRX for example. It boasts a "gigantic 16.1-inch screen." Okay, great. I'd love a 16-inch screen too. But then, in the fine print, is this laughable phrase: "Just 8.4 lbs. and 1.8" thin." Let's see, sounds like a great tradeoff, doesn't it? You get about 12 percent more screen real estate, 55.5 percent more weight and 80 percent more bulk (and faster battery drain to boot). The Sony is about 20 percent cheaper, mind you, but I already told you about that part, right? Let's compare Apples to apples, then, shall we? A new VAIO model with a 15-inch display and Combo drive sells for about a grand less than Apple's deluxe Powerbook, and a few hundred below the bottom-of-the line. You would think with a smaller display, maybe they could take out some of that bulk? Naw. This one is "Just 8.6 lbs. and 1.8" thin." I don't know about you, but if the Sonys bulk up any more, their owners will be able to throw out their old "Body By Jake" video tapes. Now, there are a number of competitors using Intel Centrino chips now that are finally becoming competitive with the Powerbooks -- you can now get wider, higher resolution screens (a great 15.4-inch model on the Compaq x1000 series) that are less ugly and heavy than before. Battery life is comparable to the Powerbooks, for once. You can now find DVD burners, though not slot-loading models. But the PC 'books all come down to being utilitarian, plastic hunks of hardware, mostly thrown together with only an eye on maximum features for minimum price. Apple's are the product of a harmonious mix of design and integration that lead to a pleasing whole. It's the only company I know of that creates 5.6 pound pieces of aluminum art that will literally have you cracking a 1,000 watt smile when you open it up for the first time...And isn't that worth a few hundred bucks? A thousand? How much did you pay for the painting above your sofa? Taking this computer with you also gets you noticed. Jealousy abounds. You are instantly associated with the "cool" people. Add an iPod and you would fit right in to any hip hangout and become a magnet for like-minded folks who appreciate that there is more to life than just megahertz. Folks who understand feng shui and design and a better way of life will be attracted to you. Trolls will be repelled. Another bonus. By the way, you might also consider buying Apple's 3-year protection plan. Sure, it's expensive, but if you bought that Picasso, would you take it with you on an airplane (not to mention through overzealous security guards) without insurance?	5.0	5.149359703063965

I should have switched to mac a long time ago!  I just recently purchased a macbook and love all the features of it.  Longtime apple users are use to the quick boot up, but I was amazed at how fast it would boot up.  Us windows users are use to about a 3-4 minute boot up unless you have no programs or a ton of ram to speed things up.  Having had three different Windows laptops, i am amazed at the long battery life, the camera, and how light this macbook is.  It is so much lighter with a better screen than my wife's Fujitsu Lifebook.  She is jealous about how fast my computer is and how simple programs such as turning a document into a pdf are already included.  For those who want a portable laptop this is the one to get.  The pro is a great machine but if you want something small, fast, and enjoy watching movies on your laptop as you travel this is the one.  I have parallels installed and xp professional installed as well on my mac with only 1gb of ram and it is very fast.  I was concerned about having both osx and xp hogging the ram but I have no problems.  I trade stocks so I can not afford for delays or crashes, but so far so good.  The search function is far superior to  windows, navigation of programs is easy, and more importantly my computer has not crashed once in 1 month!  I have put the marware protector on the wristpad and mouse pad and it has worked well.  The glue has held up well and it is not curling over.  I also put on the hardcover clear protector for the exterior.  It adds a little with, but my laptop is sitll pristine.  I am really jazzed about how apple does not nickle and dime you for support and how so much software is included when you buy their products.  I can now understand how once people switch to apple there is no going back.  I am still learning a lot about the osx and the programs so I am not an expert, but as someone who has used windows extensively, osx is a far supeior product and apple makes some great hardware that is easy on the eyes and brain!	5.0	5.146160125732422
Looks cool but massively overpriced  This is a product that is incredibly overpriced, and simply isn't worth the money. You can buy the same hardware in a computer that is $500-$600 from dell.com  Look at the inspiron or business lines to see what I mean. I got my dell computer with 4gb ram, 260gb hd, 15in screen, and a 2.6GHz penryn cpu for $200 less then this. It's simply insane to buy this unless you for some reason, have to have the apple operating system.  Apple has created a cult of people who have fallen into the trap of paying for a computer, that although works well, is one that with the same amount of money, you could get a far better computer.	2.0	1.783514142036438
Pleased so far.  Picked it up yesterday. I loved the clean look of this laptop and the screen looked very good, at least in the store display.  I had heard about all the Sony bloatware and was prepared to install XP on it or at least reinstall Vista.  However, so far, the laptop seems to be powerful enough to handle everything they have put on it.  I did uninstall all the trialware and installed AVG free for virus protection.  The screen is very good, speakers not so much.  Built-in microphone is weak and the camera is adequate.  Speed/performance is very good.  Laptop is a tad bulkier/heavier than I would like, I have a 14.1" D630 from work that I carry around and am used to that weight which is quite a bit lighter.  Had no trouble with the laptop connecting to my wireless the first time, but after a while whenever I would shutdown/hibernate/sleep the PC, it would have a lot of trouble connecting back or even finding my router.  That's a problem with the Intel wireless driver and using Windows built-in wireless manager.  It is the same chipset that I have on my D630 and had same problems.  Ended up installing Intel wireless management utility and have had no problems.  BTW, my router is US Robotics and I do not broadcast my SSID.  I have heard that linksys routers do not have much of a problem.  I plan on replacing my router with a 802.11n linksys router, so will update on that later.  Have not tried bluetooth yet.  Battery life could be better.  I am used to 4-5 hours on my D630.  This one will only go 2 or less with full brightness.  The point someone made about power connection interfering with the DVD tray is valid and I was also surprised that Sony made this design mistake, but not that big a deal.  All in all, I mostly like what I see so far.  The price I paid ($849) seems to be worth it so far.	4.0	4.047945499420166
You get what you pay for  Bought this used computer a couple of weeks ago. Don't waste your money on a used laptop. The slowest laptop ever! I was surfing faster when I had dial up. I cut my $150 loss and bought a new laptop. Lesson learned, you get what you pay for.	2.0	1.9695504903793335
Toshiba "NO"  -vs-  Amazon "YES" !!  We bought 2 of the Toshiba S4697. The first arrived with a defective power adapter/battery charger. Toshiba wouldn't ship one directly to us when Amazon asked them to. We had to contact Toshiba ourselves. Toshiba wanted us to give their support person (in Phillipines) our credit card # so they could charge us and send the replacement power adapter. Idiots, to loose a sale just because Toshiba didn't trust us to send the defective power adapter back without charging for a replacement first, at our expense no less. AMAZON worked extremely hard to rectify the problem with Toshiba, but had to have us return the entire computer for a complete refund. We also bought a SONY camera that has a memory card that the S4697 is supposed to be able to read. the Toshiba only has a 3 card reader instead of 5 card and can't read the SONY card when Toshiba states it will. AMAZON was nice enough to send us a 5 card reader for free. The second Toshiba hasn't had any problems as of August 3, 2007 (3 weeks ago) when we fired it up. WE DON'T LIKE the fact that in 3 weeks the price has gone down $60. I guess Toshiba is dumping this one.  Microsoft Windows Vista on the Toshiba S4697--My opinon is that Vista is a joke. Now you have to go to about 6 different places to change 1 setting, the changes are just bells and whistles. Soon the overwriting of software commands will bring us back to how it was when we had to type all those DOS commands to do 1 simple thing. Software now needs better hardware, uses more memory and drive space too! all to do the same thing it did before. Keeps us updating and the money wheel turning i guess...	2.0	1.175899624824524
This is not a great news !  Apple Air has great look and nice functionality, but the price is too high. And the mobility or much-advertised size and weight are not big news either. Because Acer Aspire One (A110L Intel Atom N270) is even lighter in weight as it weighs actually less than 0.9 kg! Apple Air weighs 1.36 kg! Much more important, Acer Aspire One cost only about 350 dollars. With what you pay for Apple Air, you can buy 4 Acer Aspire One ! And it has 80 GB in harddisk, XP, and Wlan. Now it is a big hot item in Scandinavia. While in the US, people are paying 4 times to buy this thing? And call it a great invention? Go figure!	3.0	3.010486602783203
... a 2007ish computer in 2015 is probably not the best idea--even for a mac  Buying a 2007ish computer in 2015 is probably not the best idea--even for a mac. It over heats way too easily, the battery life is awful, and it's very very slow. Doing anything simple is too much for the poor thing (streaming videos, playing music, hell, even loading up the internet browser takes a good 5 minutes on a good day). I can't even get the laptop to pick up the camera that's built into it. You're better off getting a newer model. Just think about it, it's roughly an 8 year old system. Time has changed far too much for this little guy to keep up.	2.0	1.9664148092269897
Did not like it for the price  I purchased this to get better performence. I had a VGN-FS780 before. The only thing I can say good about this is it is a fast machine and the case looks nice.  I ended up returning mine.  The cooling fan is to loud and it blows the exhaust out the left side which I didn't like it is easy to cover it while grabbing the machine.  Also the screen on this was very dissapointing. I was used to my old Vaio with a nice bright screen. This computer has a nice screen BUT only if your looking at it straight on.  If you stand up and look down at this comuter you cant see much at all. Its similar to the rear projection tvs where you have to be in the sweet spot to get the best picture.  Also I did not like the design of the static mouse. I am used to running my fingers over the pad to FEEL for the button. On this machine they made the buttons flush with the surface so you have to look at the pad to find the buttons	2.0	1.9464383125305176

Great for everything.... but not for spreadsheets  I guess all Apple reviews eventually become a comparison between PCs and Windows to the virtues of Macs.  Most of us really only have these two options.... we can look at RAM, memory, processor speed and a variety of other indicators - but to be honest what characteristics really matters? Hopefully, this review can help make this as painless as possible for the non-tech savvy (The power users already have their preferences). By the way, I use both PCs and Macs during the course of the day, so I will give my opinion on the strengths and weaknesses.  Apple - Strengths  -  The Apple goes from "off" to "surfing the internet" in 15 seconds. It is truly amazing how fast it gets booted-up and ready to run. -  Video editing is a breeze - lots of power here. - Lack of viruses ...there are some... but not nearly as many as Windows based computers...an added benefit is that you don't have use "Norton" or "McAfee" and all of the annoying pop-ups that those programs provide. - Ichat... my wife is able to have a picture perfect video conference with her sister every night...even though they live 2500 miles a part. The best part? It is free! - Apple support is top-notch! You make an appointment at a store and they bend over backwards to help you! This is sooo much better than calling into some random help desk. - Quality of construction - sorry, I have had to many PCs die from hardware related issues over the last 5 years... Apple's seem to last forever.  Apple - Weaknesses  -Spreadsheets - It is true you can get a Mac version of Excel - but it is absolutely horrible. Things that you take for granted on Windows based Excel...i.e adding a comment in a cell are missing! - You can not buy (at least at the time of this review) music and videos on Amazon.com - they do not support Macs at this time. - Lack of programs in general. While there are many cool programs and games for PCs there are only a handful available for the Mac. - Attaching photos to email is not as easy as using a PC and Yahoo. - a 13.3" monitor really is too small.  My final recommendation? If you have to have ONE computer you probably want to strongly consider a PC. The  variety of programs and the power of spreadsheets have become critical to most of us.... especially for our jobs. However, if you need a computer simply for "fun" (not counting games) and surfing the internet the Apple is impossible to beat.  If you need a computer for work or Video Games = PC/windows If you need a compuer for surfing the internet/photos/videos = Apple/MacOS	4.0	2.7732324600219727
PC SWEEPERS SUCKS  PC SWEEPERS have horrid costumer service. I was sent a laptop in a flipsy box that was torn and out of shape. The laptop was fine cosmetic wise. As SOON as I turn on the laptop fresh out of the package a grey folder with a question mark pops up and it doesn't go to the start up screen. I trouble shoot the issue as much as I can and nothing works. I message them and all they do is send me a link to something I've already tried. (No help at all really the computer was suppose to have a new hardrive in it and it clearly wasn't hooked up correctly) they then tell me to return it to them.  BET I file the claim and return it but I HAVE TO PAY THIRTY DOLLARS to return it to them! What the hey now! Then it gets to them and the guy goes well it turned on for me perfectly without any issues. Uh of course it works for you right? The man who know computers? Basically he's calling me dumb and saying that I might be charged an extra fee out of my refund for a servicing fee. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS GO TO BEST BUY OR BUY A NEW ONE.	1.0	1.9451912641525269

MacBook is my favorite toy!  Bought mine in December and am in love with it.  Also own the iMac which has had some glitches and the Mac Mini.

Compact, cute and SLOW  Purchased my EEE 900 for 369.  Happy with its size.  Easy to carry.  Disappointed with its speed.  Seems quite slow compared to my desktop.  If you're used to faster than 900 speed you'll be disappointed when you expect this machine to function as your desktop does. Have researched CPU upgrades and they are minimal.  No easy upgrades available because the CPU seems sodered in to the motherboard so upgrades require alot of work.	2.0	2.965521812438965

Defective Motherboard Issues?  I agree as well; there is a problem with this computer screen.  It does not appear on the start up screen but only on the active background.  Lines at the top and trying to open and close Windows is extremely problematic.  I have to close them at the bottom in the dialog box.  This problem appeared almost immediately.  This is definitely a problem with the motherboard.  In addition the Vista/Toshiba combination is horribly slow.  It takes forever for this computer to respond when using pictures and moving files.  This is one of those computers that looks good on paper but in real life is a total dud.  Consumer Reports had this as a "Best Buy" but I guess they just ran clock speed tests; anyone who actually uses this computer will be well aware of functionality issues.  This may be restricted to the models displaying the Toshiba motherboard defect but my experience matches the others.	1.0	2.006502151489258
This is the worst laptop I have ever owned.  I put up with my first Dell Latitude D600 for about a year before finally just throwing it away.  After maybe 3 months of owning it, at least 6 of the keys fell off, the battery stopped working, and I was not able to pick up wireless connections.  It died three times during the time period that I owned it, and after replacing the hard drive twice and the fan once, I realized that it just wasn't worth trying to "fix" anymore.  Unfortunately, I received the exact same model of laptop as a gift after my previous one died.  This confirmed my belief that this model is an absolute piece of crap.  I have owned it less than a year, and the battery does not work, the power cord falls out all the time, a key has fallen off, and I have already had it sent off twice for repairs on the hard drive.  Recently, it physically fell into two pieces; the screen just detached from the keyboard and now it's utterly useless and will not turn on.  I handled these laptops responsibly.  They always sat either on my desk or on my lap and I never took them out of my home.  I used them mostly for surfing the net and photo-editing, rarely downloaded anything, and did not clog it up with loads of pictures and music (it could only handle about 10 folders of music before being completely full anyway).  If you want a laptop that falls apart and constantly breaks from normal use, then this is the one for you.	1.0	0.904315173625946

I love this computer  I bought this computer for music production only (Logic, Reason, and Ableton Live).  After realizing how much I love Mac computers / operating system, I have transferred all files over from my PC and put the PC up for sale.  I will never buy a PC again....take that to the bank!!!  The new sandy bridge core i5 is screaming fast.  I can't see how a quad core can be much faster for what I'm using this computer for.  Plus the 13" is the sweet size for portability and use.  This computer is also $1,000 cheaper than the 15".  I just don't get why people would buy the 15" or 17" models.  Some claim it's because of the discrete graphics card.  If you are a hardcore gamer, you shouldn't buy a macbook pro period.  Macbook pro's are for creation (music production, photo editing, and video editing / development)....period!!  You could buy the 2011 AND 2012 macbook pro 13" for the same price as the 2011 macbook pro 15".  Keep in mind that the 2011 macbook pro 13" is faster than EVERY macbook pro model from 2010 (technology moves too fast!).  I wouldn't be surprised if this happens again next year, and you will be able to get a quad core in the 13" for $1200.  Warning: Don't get the 13" i7 processor.  Apple has disabled the turbo boost because the computer gets too hot.  The 2.3ghz i5 processor turbo boosts up to 2.9ghz, while the i7 is only 2.7ghz (and supposed to turbo boost to 3.4ghz).  What's the point of having the i7 when you can't turbo boost to 3.4ghz (b/c of being disabled by APPLE)??  Apple should be sued for false advertising, or at least offer the i7 at the same price as the i5.  Save yourself the $300 and have a faster processor!!!!  Also upgrade to 8gb of ram...totally worth it.  It cost me $60 to do this, and then I sold the 4gb stock ram for $30...for a net cost of $30!!!  Apple charges $200 to upgrade the ram for you, which can be done by a middle schooler (watch youtube videos on it).  What a ripoff.  My next upgrade will be an Solid State Drive...once the 256GB drive comes down in price.  Again this is easy to install yourself.	5.0	4.87238073348999
Excellent budget laptop  1st, battery life is about 2+ hours at the max which is average. It's missing an express card slot but has 3 2.0 usb slots. No bluetooth but wifi g. The cover doesn't "latch" shut and there are is no s/d card reader. What makes this laptop very good is the price / features, processor and o/s. This is my 2nd Vista premium computer and now that I have worked out the kinks ( reducing the page file to 650 mb, turning off unnecessary services and using tweak vi(tm) to tune it up) it's actually fairly quick. The downside is tons of trial ware (ms office 2007, symantic, & the intrusive HP Help Center) but these are rectified by simply uninstalling. The set up is VERY long with vista because MS will have to upload in excess of 20 critical updates right after you boot up the 1st time. But Vista is elegant, and uses ram MUCH better than xp. Also vista Side bar Gadgets are cool as well. If you can get this under $500 you have a decent bargain, but more than that I would compare very hard with other models. If I got this under $400 I would give it 5, 6 or 7 stars but at $449 with no tax or shipping this is a 4.5 star deal out of 5. HP / Compaq products have always been very good to me so I expect quality and long life.	4.0	4.066315650939941
Noise from the notebook  Compared with Dell Latitude D620, the SONY VAIO VGN-280 notebook has a soft but noticeable buzz. I think the noise may come from the fan.

Poor quality LCD  I know the LCD of the new Macbook is not very good, but I didn't expect that it is is that bad. It is not on par with quite some other laptops on the market with much lower price tags.  1. The black and contrast level very poor, comparing side by side with another laptop, the darkest black you can get is a dark gray.  2. The viewing angle is extremely narrow. I am NOT as picky as to use a laptop while walking around, just move my head a little bit produces noticeable artifacts.  So when viewing or watching dark toned pictures or videos, ink patches like effect is very obvious, though for more vibrant colored scenes like the factory supplied background pictures and the ones showing in Apple store, with the help of the bright LED backlight and glossy coating, it does not seem to be that bad.  The new Macbook is definitely trendy and tremendously good looking as a successful consumer electronic, but the poor quality display will surely diminish its usefulness as any slightly serious tool for photo and video processing, which ironically boasted as the Mac's appeal all along.  On the bright side, the Mac OS is very responsive and quick comparing to Windows Vista, thought you may find that the system settings configurable with the UI interface is limited to make the system less complex. One thing I found missing is that you can not change to use larger fonts at system level, it might be hard to read some texts.	2.0	2.9684619903564453
I like this notebook very much  This is the third notebook I've owned.  The main reason I bought this notebook is because I was so dissatisfied with the noise level of my other notebook.  This notebook has functioned very well so far for about a month.  It is very quiet, light, and cool to the touch.  I am typing this review while the notebook is on my legs, and I've got shorts on!  It is not much warmer than my body temperature and the fan is just barely detectable most of the time.  Every once in a while, the fan comes on loudly but only for about 2 to 3 seconds, then I don't hear it again for a very long time.  I'm not a big fan of Vista so far.  It seems to run well enough, but there have been some problems with software compatibility.  I have a couple of programs that don't run in Vista that ran just fine in XP.  I'm hoping that these problems are worked out soon and I've been able to come up with workarounds for the most troublesome program.  One major annoyance to me is the fact that the keyboard has been made a little  narrower than a full size keyboard.  The way this was accomplished was by narrowing all the keys to the right of the <, L, and P keys.  Also, for some reason, there is an additional \| key to the right of the up arrow key.  The addition of this unnecessary key, along with the slightly narrower right side keys has resulted in a shift key that is about 1/3rd of the width of the left shift key.  I wish there was an easy way to map the redundant \| key to be an up arrow and then reprogram the up arrow to be an additional right shift key.  I am getting better at typing on this computer but I've moved the cursor up a line by accidentally  pressing the up arrow instead of the shift key numerous times.  One more keyboard complaint; There are no dedicated "Home" or "End" keys.  If you want to use those, they can only be used when the numeric keypad is off or if you also press the shift key.  I also wish there was a volume button on the top of the computer with the rest of the multimedia keys.  The volume is controlled either by software controls or by a thumbwheel which is on the front edge of the computer just to the left of the antenna power switch.  It would probably be ok where it is if there was an icon on the top next to the edge to show where it is located.  The wheel is black and the case where the switch is also black, so it's hard to see without raising the front of the computer a little to look for it.  I didn't think I would use the fingerprint security but I've been using it and it seems to work fairly well.  I've gotten to the point now that I'm  lazy about typing in my password.  I'd rather just swipe my finger.  You have to be consistent about how you move your finger across the sensor, but once you get the hang of it, there are not that many bad scans.  The computer has plenty of hard drive space with it's 160GB, 5400 rpm drive.  It's pretty responsive too, with quick load times for most programs and responsive web browsing.  The wireless networking seems to work fine but I haven't really tried to check the limits of wireless reception.  It works well in my house and in my garage so far.  The power supply is probably only about 1/3rd of the size and weight of the one used by my previous computer (which had a P4, 2.8 Mhz processor).  I don't think the  battery time is all that great on this but I haven't really given it a good test.  I use it while it's plugged in most of the time.  It is noticeably slower when running on the battery though.  The sound is fine by me but I don't listen to that much music or play any games.  The video is also fine but then again, I haven't really tested it very thoroughly since I just use it for office-type applications and browsing.  Overall, it's a very nice computer and I'm satisfied to have it.  I am disappointed about the keyboard, and I would have rated it with 5 stars if it wasn't for that. I'm learning to use the keyboard better and I think that with practice, it won't be so annoying.	4.0	3.389625310897827

Overpriced Cool  I had problems out the box and I'm never happy with problems out the box. I couldn't get the wireless to work. Apparently Xandro's network protocols does not like spaces in its passphrase. I've used Xandros before and this enforced why Xandros is my least favorite Linux distro. So ok that's easily fixed by adjusting my passphrase. At least it supports WPA2 so no worries.  After connecting the wifi I started looking for the full desktop. This actually isn't for me it's a Valentines Day gift for my wife but I'll be the one doing maintenance on it if something goes wrong, so I wanted to work out of the full desktop mode, which isn't initially available. I can only guess that #1: Xandros is very "Windows-like" and they wanted to avoid the confusion of noobies navigating it and/or #2: Asus wanted to prevent the customer service calls of people complaining they installed something and in the process, broke something, and that anyone interested in jumping the hurdle to enable it should be savvy enough to know what they're doing. That said, it comes with 2 repositories installed and I'd be cautious about what other repositories you add. I stuck with adding a Xandros specific repository and one debian repository. So a quick internet search found the commands to enable the full desktop and switching back and forth is as easy as two-three clicks. Ok problem #2 out the way.  Problem (well, not really a problem) #3 is the Asus EEE does not read inserted media correctly. If you mouse over the card icon on the task bar you get the correct size. But if you use the file manager, instead of getting the total size of the SD card, etc. you only get the amount of space that's actually used. So if you have a 16GB MMC-SD with a just a 600MB movie file on it, Asus will read the size of the card as 600MB. Not a biggie though you do have write access to the total amount of GB the card has and all the files on the card.  It's actually bigger than I was led to believe from video and photos on the net. Nonetheless I cursed at every misspelling as I fought the tiny size of the keyboard. But after a few hours I got used to it and the overpriced tech flavor of the month slowly began to grow on me.  Despite my preference for the desktop mode, the sorta PDA mode appeals more. The Asus really is well designed and well laid out with big eye pleasing icons. All your major internet and computer functions are a couple clicks away. I threw several multimedia file formats at it and it handled them all with the exception of VOB. I didn't try that because I convert them to a mpeg format anyway. The screen really is to die for. At seven inches it looks better than the 15.1 inch screen on my Thinkpad. Some complain about the speakers taking up space for the screen; that the screen could've been a little bigger if the speakers were moved say to the bottom of the keyboard. The trade off is, you get really excellent sound from those speakers. I was really surprised at the fidelity. My Thinkpad has the speaks on the bottom and they sound like crap.  I will not be switching to Windows. I casually asked my wife (as not to give away the gift) what she thought about Linux and all she said was, "it's ok. I would just want access to Yahoo and Chikka." Both are easily done through Pidgin. One thing I love about Pidgin is the tabbed message windows, so you don't eat up your screen real estate with several windows open at once. So there's little reason for me to switch it to Windows for her, although a dual boot would be nice which is what I do with my Thinkpad and Opensuse.  The lack of an optical drive isn't really a huge issue as there are ways around that, but for me it's still an issue nonetheless as is the limited storage space. I'd stop short of calling this a full fledged laptop. It's not. I don't think that's quite the market Asus was aiming for. But it's worth mentioning because for close to the same price I paid [...] you can get a full fledged laptop with 60GB of space, a DVD drive and Vista (which I'm not crazy about) or XP and you can still install Linux for a dualboot if you love Linux like I do. So basically, it's overpriced. Very cool, but overpriced.  But hey Valentine's Day is coming. I know the wife wants a laptop and I know size is of the utmost concern for her. She wants to put it in her purse and there is no other laptop she can do that with. So I plunked down almost $[...]for it being so cool and because love makes you do crazy things. Now I just need to hide it 'til Valentines Day, which noting the size, should not be a problem.	4.0	2.9302122592926025
Pretty much perfect  Pretty much a perfect $1,000 laptop with so much intelligent attention to the user interface.  (Little details like the magnetic power cord attachment are much appreciated - I once pulled my laptop onto the floor by tripping on the power cord so I know.)  I  bought this for my daughter and now I want one.	5.0	4.027950286865234
No battery life  Battery last about an hour. For a mac that's disgraceful. It's not a laptop because of the battery. I have to use it as a desktop so I can consytantky charge it.	2.0	1.0144662857055664
No USB 3  I purchased the top o' the line Macbook Pro 15" (with extra memory, 2.5 GHz, and the high-rez / no-glare screen option). It's, of course, a great machine. I knocked a star off my review because of the battery life and the (I assume necessary) fan sound. My MBP from a couple of years ago didn't have an audible fan noise, and the fan never kicked into "high gear" like this one does on occasion. It's a more powerful machine, so I guess this comes with the territory. This increased power also seems to have shortened the duration of a battery charge. Don't fall for the "up to seven hours". I get MAYBE half that. Yes, I'm a power user, but even with simple tasks (and the screen at about 40%), the battery still drains faster than my old unit. It's a brilliant device, so these aspects are annoyances that I can live with. Oh, I am also disappointed that the 15" MBP doesn't have USB 3. It's got USB 2 and firewire. Of course it has Thunderbolt, but that's not yet embraced by very many third party devices. I picked up an external back-up drive with firewire, but it was a bummer to shop and see all the drives with USB 3. Apparently only the 17" MBP has USB 3. BTW, I much prefer the no-glare screen.	4.0	3.375164031982422

h  Ive been a long time windows user and after seeing windows vista, i knew i had to switch to mac. so i did, and theres nothing that would bring me back to windows. I like everything about my macbook with osx leopard. it is so fast, usually opening a program on my windows machine would take forever, but with my mac, i can open programs in a matter of seconds. for example opening itunes on windows would take sometimes 2 minutes, but on the mac, just a few seconds. I like all the extras it came with, i like the built in isight with photo booth and ichat is great for video chatting. mail syncs up with my gmail account easily, didn't have to go through with all the crap like with outlook. iphoto is pretty cool. time machine is great, just plug in my drive and it backs up right there. and time capsule just came out, so you can backup wirelessly now. and stacks in the dock are a good organizational tool. overall, this is a great computer with many awesome features	5.0	5.14689302444458
good if you like bare bones  This company, unlike a competitor that I bought the same kind of computer from, sent a unit in good condition with a ton of bubble wrap around it. The computer itself works well besides a few barely visible black dots under the screen. My only concern with these computers is the fact there is no way to reset them. They seem to have been changed somehow with the reset partition absent. Basically if theres any glitch you have to track it down I suppose. Its still a Windows computer with XP but updating it can be a little cumbersome due to older service packs and architecture. Considering that you now can buy a google chrome book for 250.00, it seems to me older models like this should come down to 150.00 in very good / excellent condition, and 100.00 or less for the ones sort of like the one I got from they're competitor. Since there is no reset if theres a major problem, I suppose the boot menu and diagnostics are your friend here.	3.0	3.007160186767578
OK, but a few issues  I had to get another laptop after my other macbook broke. Both of my last 2 laptops by Apple broke. They lasted about 2 1/2 years and the way that I use them everyday that is probably about right. The one problem that both seemed to have was the logic board issue. This computer is no where near as fast as I thought it should be. I love the exterior. Apple makes great looking laptops, but I worry that the quality is going somewhat downhill. I have purchased 100s (some through business) of mac products in the last 2 decades and they are just not made like they were 20 years ago.  In some ways they are better. The software is certainly better and OS X is the best operating system compared to linux and Windows. I have always had Windows machines in the house too and OS X blows them out in comparison. As an everyday machine this computer is much better than the Mac Mini, which was a laptop processor in a different form.  What I loved: I plugged up a firewire to my broken computer and was able to bring everything over to my new macbook in about 2 hours. The battery life is much better. The computer is lighter and appears stronger than the previous two computers out shell.  What I did not like: The computer is slighty slow. Apple, why did you change the power supply port and put it on the left. That has to be the worse spot period. There appears to be some connectivity issues with Apple AirPort. I have to reboot a lot. However, I think I should have started with a clean install. My problems may stem from some of the earlier preferences of that computer conflicting with the new system. I will update after that. Otherwise, my problems are with freezes on programs such as safari, and firefox, and slow Office suite. I try not to use Office just because how slow it is on the Mac. My other programs such as word processor Mellel work great.  Conclusion, it could be a reinstall with help. Otherwise, love the exterior, wish the computer were easier to upgrade as it needs more RAM.	4.0	4.0079874992370605
Great laptop for just about anyone  I bought this macbook to replace my old one that I bought back in early 2006 and unfortunately spilled water on. I managed to snag it for almost $200 off on black friday and what a deal! I know this is the lowest model macbook, but unless you absolutely NEED to burn DVDs this one is a great way to save some money. My last laptop had the DVD burner and I think I used it once, I just find it easier to transfer files online or using usb flash drives so the $200 off was more worthwhile than the burner.  This thing also flies once you install some extra memory. You can buy 4GB for under $100 nowadays and have a laptop that will be ready and able to run most of the software you want for a good long time.  The only people I wouldn't recommend to buy this are people who want to play graphics-intensive games, since the graphics processor in the macbooks is pretty weak. But that's what the xbox 360 is for!	5.0	4.0524396896362305

Poor item.  I did not have any good affection for this item because since I received it I did not use it, it was full of virus and low memory, I requested a return label from the seller for replacement they replied me that they're sorry they can not send me a replacement because the laptop was fixed and setup good before they ship it to me. I am not very happy because it is like I trashed my money away, how can I buy something that I did not use and for the seller to replace to me and keep a customer they said no, I did not ask for a refound but it is ok, I will dump the laptop and God will be in charge.

Bad Video Card  This computer had a bad video card.  It worked for a couple of months and then started having problems booting.  It started right after an apple update and I thought it was software related.  I finally broke down and took it in to the shop and was told the video card was no good.  The replacement of the chip was $600 so I would steer clear of this for sure.  Buy somewhere with a warranty.	1.0	0.9041260480880737

Excellent overall  I purchased this laptop in May of 2004 to replace a PowerBook G3 (Pismo).  Overall, I have been extremely satisfied with it's performance, stability and feature set.  For those users looking for an excellent compromise between portability and power, this laptop should satisfy.  Pros:  - Large, crisp display that automatically brightens/dims based on ambient light  - Backlit keyboard that works very well in low-light conditions  - Excellent performance from a relatively low clock-speed processor  - Acceptable battery life (3+ hours during normal use, 1.5 hours during heavy gaming).  - Case is easy to clean and surprisingly resistant to scratches  - Every port and connection imaginable:  Bluetooth, 802.11b/g, FireWire 400/800, USB2.0, s-video, DVI, gigabit ethernet, etc.  - Lightweight, considering the screen size.  - Very stable; no "hard" crashes since purchase.  - Phenomenal customer and technical support and unusually fast turnaround times for repairs.  Cons:  - The bottom of the unit can get uncomfortably hot if the processor speed is set to "highest".  Most noticeably during heavy gameplay.  - Lid hinge tends to become stiff over time, leading to creaks.  Overall, a machine that should please both Mac-afficionados and curious PC users considering the switch to Apple.	5.0	5.157392501831055
Love it, but does have some problems  I love this laptop. It has great features, it's small and lightweight, and it looks amazing. However there definetly are some things I do not like  - it gets very hott  - the mooing noise of the fans can get VERY annoying  - battery life w/wireless on is only around 3 hrs  - 512 RAM is not enough  - 60 gig is not enough  For the same price in a pc laptop you could get a laptop that is probably faster and has around a 100 gig hard drive. However for me overall it is worth extra money because i love all the software that mac comes with, i love the quality of macs, and i love that it can dual boot windows and mac. Overall it is a good laptop w/some flaws.	4.0	4.0255584716796875
Do Not buy a Toshiba A135-S2386 laptop- It's a lemon  Within 10 days of owning a new Toshiba A135-S2386 laptop, the wireless card stopped working. When I called Tech Support, they taught me to go to Device Manager and re-install the driver.  Or sometimes I had to restart the laptop.  I had to do that every week.  Then after 3 months, the wireless card stopped working and restarting the computer didn't help.  Took it to a Toshiba authorized repair person who changed the network card.  Two months later, same problem.  Network card, motherboard AND antenna were all replaced.  When I got the computer back, it immediately started freezing and blue screening.  Brought it back to the repair center the next day and they put in a new harddrive.  After putting in the new harddrive, the repair center called me and told me that the keyboard and mouse quit working.  So now they are ordering a second motherboard.  During all of this I have called Toshiba numerous times.  When I told them I want a new laptop, they put me put on hold for 30 - 40 minutes then the call will mysteriously cut off.  I have called now 4 times asking for the status of my request for a laptop and the same thing happens - they tell me they will transfer me to customer support and after 30 minutes, the call will disconnect.  I am a student and during all of this I do not have my laptop to get my work done. Toshiba customer is a joke. They do not care.  Once they get your money for the laptop, they fix and fix until your warranty runs out, then you're stuck with a lemon laptop.  I've owned Dell laptops before with no problems whatsoever.  I will never buy a Toshiba ANYTHING ever again.	1.0	0.9040038585662842

Great machine, few flaws  Yeah, I know it's a little more money than the knock-off PC clones from Dell and Gateway, but this is a far superior computer. The Mac platform is not only the most powerful one available, it is also the simplest and most versatile - once you learn it. The 15-inch is the perfect size for me. I looked at both the 12 and 17-inch models and felt they were a little too small/big respectively. There is something attractive about the 12 inch - a friend of mine has one and he carries it around everywhere, able to write anywhere anytime. And seated at a desk the 17-inch is also attractive, presenting a massive, bright screen to work on. But all in all, the 15-inch provides the best both worlds. It's very portable - maybe not as easy to tug along as the 12-inch, but certainly manageable with a small backpack. The 17-inch can be problematic on a plane if there are people crowding you, and it's certainly cumbersome to maneuver in tight spaces, whereas the 12-inch is easy to maneuver but can cause a little eyestrain from a distance. I definitely recommend a Mac, first of all, and within that I recommend the 15-inch G4 notebook. If you must have a 12-inch, you might take a look at the 12-inch iBook, which is cheaper but obviously not as feature rich (the iBook's graphics card is not as powerful and the processor is slower, most notably). The complaints I have are exterior - the computer doesn't age well (i.e., it nicks and scratches rather easily) and there should be some sort of elevation device to raise the back end while typing (like the older Powerbooks had). All in all you can't go wrong with any Apple laptop you choose. They are truly making the digital life a reality with all of their integrated software - iTunes, iPhoto, iSight, and the iPod are particularly cool. No other laptop will have an operating system with so many fantastic programs that are so perfectly integrated together. If this is remotely in your price range, go for it. It can literally change the way you operate on a day-to-day basis.	4.0	5.1464715003967285

Great but bummed about burn out pixel on lcd screen  I love my macbook pro except for the fact that I paid a ton of money for a new product that had a burn out pixel on the lcd screen. According to Amazon, they won't accept a return if only one pixel is burnt out. Nice how they don't tell you that up front. I paid for a fully functioning product, not one that has a defect no matter how small it is to them.  Apple products are well designed but not durable or of high quality materials. Reminds me of when I dropped my ipod from 2ft off the ground and it ceased to function.	3.0	3.0121326446533203
Good PC choice  By its price Satellite is a good PC,I have been able to run and test performance as well as included features.  I have had problems regarding the wireless connectivity, I am not sure whether those problems are due to Vista or notebook itself but sometimes a restart is needed to get connection alive again.  Furthermore, energy consumption is a bit high, full battery load does not last more than a couple of hours, It is the only thing I am disappointed about.

Amazing UMPC  The recent reviews are all dead on. This is a superb machine, with a screen that is readily visible out of doors, good battery life (3+ hours), easy to use track-point and mouse buttons, and a brilliantly realized docking station. It has everything a Windows XP computer should have, at about the size of a 4x6 index card, and less than an inch thick. It is a super toy, and yet with a bluetooth keyboard it is a fully functioning computer in every way.  I have written several thousand words of a book on mine, without straining my eyes (set the display to "margin width"). While the regular display of web pages may be too tiny for some (I can manage, but I don't need reading glasses), it has a zoom button right below the mouse-pointer. The built-in keyboard is easy to use, mostly with thumbs, but a touch typist can bring in other fingers to increase speed. Since for as little as $100 one can add a bluetooth foldable keyboard, this is one great little machine to use.  The UX280 comes with Win XP SP2, and anyone concerned by Vista should snap up one of these while they are still available (and half the price of the UX380). It works like any other computer with external drives attached - through the USB or Firewire connections on the dock - and with bluetooth, a LAN connection, and wireless networking, it is a cinch to synchronize with a desktop or other computer. All in all, this is a fabulous computer in an amazingly tiny package.	5.0	5.1470046043396

Recovery Issues  I had a lot of trouble upgrading from XP Home that came bundled with my FRV37 to XP Professional. I had to do a fresh installation of XP Pro that formatted my machine. This also resulted in loosing all of the preloaded software. I just ordered for a set of Recovery DVD's from sony for $35. I fail to understand why Sony wants to save on recovery CDs... Customers beware!!! Do not try updrading the machine to XP Professional. Sony does not support it.	2.0	1.9661937952041626
DEFECTIVE LAPTOP WILL NOT CHARGE, FAULTY CHARGER, CLAIMS OF WARRANTY ARE FALSE BUYER BEWARE! WASTE OF MONEY!SELLER WON'T RESPOND  I am deeply dissatisfied. I decided to go with this laptop because I wanted to get the feel of a macbook before I invested in the newer edition for hundreds even thousands of dollars. I chose this seller because it stated that it came preloaded with many apps that I thought beneficial to my career as I am a student and vlogger. Final Cut Express, Imovie. Microsoft Office Suite etc. I knew I would not be able to access the new apple store for downloads because the laptop is so outdated so I thought I had the upper hand with this purchase since everything was already there.  Yes apps were there. But my main problem was with the laptop's ability to hold charge. It would die very quickly and I would need to almost always keep it plugged in. I would plug in the charger which is magnetic and it would say plugged in but not charging or the light on the charger would fail to light up at all. I would have to plug in the charger then take it out repeatedly in order for it to charge. It was a real gamble like lottery the way to computer seemed to choose when it would charge or not charge. I wish I had captured video of what I am describing before the laptop completely shut off due to it failing to charge.  Cause now it is just sitting here completely dead and useless. In addition to this. When I received the laptop it had paperwork inside promising a 90 day warranty if I registered on a site. Well, when I visited this site, it was nonexistent. The whole point of me buying such a small laptop is because I had plans on doing some work on the go. However, due to the faulty charging I have had this laptop in the house only. I basically wasted my money because all the purposes I bought it for went in vain. The laptop could never stay alive long enough for me to edit my vlogs and since it was unreliable with charging I had no choice but to leave it home at all times. This laptop has never been dropped, charger was kept in a safe storage place, I even purchased a shell for it. It was faulty within the first week of me having it and I never got good use out of this product. I am deeply hurt and wish I had purchased one eligible for assurion warranty but I was so set on the preloaded software that I looked past a warranty, stupidly. I trusted that the product wouldn't break down and it did. I haven't heard any response from the seller and it's as if their mentality is that of well it's past 30 days at this point so who cares we have her money. Even though I contacted them regarding this issue before 30 days. Since the laptop is dead all my vlogs in imovie I am no longer able to access. I am hurt and in possession of a laptop that is just taking up space at this point. Please, go with another seller and one that's eligible for warranty. Seller has phone number listed which is a personal cellphone that no one answers even if you leave voicemails. Seller does not respond to emails. Sincerely, A vlogger in pain Update as of February 17, 2017 I was informed that I still indeed had 90-day warranty. The seller responded & gave me some options. Either a full refund upon returning the laptop, a replacement charger & if that didn't work a refund or a replacement laptop and if that was defective a full refund would be issued. The person I communicated with Kelvin was very helpful. Upon evaluating my issues with the laptop he concluded that it was likely a charger issue & not the laptop itself. He quickly shipped me a brand new charger. Once I received the charger Voila! my precious laptop began to work again. Laptop came loaded with all software as promised including Imovie, FinalCutExpress, Adobe Photoshop, Microsoft Office Suite & more. Reliable seller.  Issue as of April 2017 screen malfunctioned & I had to purchase a replacement lcd & install it myself. Sill going strong until I have the means to purchase a newer macbook 2018.	3.0	2.0057454109191895

My first MacBook  Ok, I just got my first MacBook and I will say that thus far it has been very nice...but with that sence I am BRAND NEW to the whole Apple OS it has been kinda frustrating. I mean I don't know it might be me but there is alot of things that I don't have any idea how to do. For instance buring a CD. I insert a DISK and it tells me something about making a play list on Itunes and then clicking the BURN botton in the lower right hand corner...I looked for that button for a while and I still can not figure out how to burn a disk.   See what the problem really is is that I am trying to put all my music from my ipod onto my new MacBook and I cant figure out how to do it without deleting all my mucic that is on my ipod. And sence I am in Iraq my ipod is like my lifeline alot of the time. I really don't feel like having all my cd's shipped from back home here to iraq only to have to ship them back before I leave.  Can anyone help me out with this?	4.0	3.071131467819214
not bad  The product is working ok, apart from one thing. Sometimes, when I am working on it for a longer time I can hear some noises in it, I mean a kind of creaking and rustle. I am worried about that. What is more the DVD drive is working quite loud. What I would also like to mention is that Windows Vista is a very big mistake of Microsoft, it causes many problems to work with it. I used to have Windows XP installed on my laptop and it was much more comfortable. That's enough if there's about disadvantages. It is a typical entertainment laptop and I love to listen to music or watch movies on it.	3.0	3.0162508487701416

Hidden defect not indicated  Everything looked great when I started using the computer. However, I found typing very difficult as the cursor moved and my next word was in the middle of a line of text three lines up or even in a different open document. I had an apple consultant discover the keyboard was defective as when an external keyboard was attached, everyhting worked as it's supposed to. Thus, I had to have the keyboard replaced. This defect was not indicated by the seller, but I cannot see how he could have missed it.	3.0	3.0248401165008545
BROKEN SEAL!!!  I received my order today and the seal was broken! Having read the reviews I asked Amazon twice before buying about the seal and they did not give a straight answer, just said that " they will take full responsibility if something is wrong". I asked them to let me know if they ship open boxes, to avoid having to return the item.  I reported the issue to Sony, they will investigate with Amazon.  As far as I know it is illegal to advertize and sell open boxes as a new product.	1.0	0.9065515995025635

Not good out of the box, better after BIOS update  I have had exactly the same 100% processor utilization issues as Harold McFarland.  I sent an email to Acer Tech Support one week ago and have yet to receive anything other than their automated "we received your email" reply.  I have spent many hours getting this laptop setup and have had to power off and restart the machine about a dozen or more times when the processor pegged out at 100% and stayed there.  I finally had the last straw today and decided to take it back to Staples where I bought it a week or so ago.  I did a search for "Acer 4810 100% processor" and came up with this report.  I had already updated the drivers, but not the BIOS.  Thanks to Harold, I downloaded the BIOS update (now 1.28) and flashed the BIOS.  While the jury is still out on whether it is now fixed, I hope to have the same experience as Harold and others.  It's ashame ACER support are so non-responsive and oblivious to the problem.  If I have to power down one more time because of processor lock-up, it will go back to Staples.  I will also update this comment if I do.  Update:  It locked up again today, processor stuck at 100% and stayed there until I powered off and re-started.  I deleted all of my personal data and programs that I had installed and returned it for a refund.  Such a shame as this computer would have been perfect for me had it not had this problem.	3.0	0.9242119789123535

Looks cool but massively overpriced  This is a product that is incredibly overpriced, and simply isn't worth the money. You can buy the same hardware in a computer that is $500-$600 from dell.com  Look at the inspiron or business lines to see what I mean. I got my dell computer with 4gb ram, 260gb hd, 15in screen, and a 2.6GHz penryn cpu for $200 less then this. It's simply insane to buy this unless you for some reason, have to have the apple operating system.  Apple has created a cult of people who have fallen into the trap of paying for a computer, that although works well, is one that with the same amount of money, you could get a far better computer.	2.0	1.783514142036438
Beware - it's actually a COMPAQ!  Worked for about the first 15 minutes, then started having fatal errors (aka "the blue screen of death") every time I ran more than one application at the same time. Could've spent time troubleshooting, but a computer should perform better than this straight out of the box. If I had known it was really a Compaq in HP clothes I would have never bought it (you don't find this out until you turn it on and look around - I guess that explains the low price). The only bright spot is the fact that I got a full refund including the cost of shipping it back to Amazon.	1.0	0.9055414795875549

Great core/features, needs fine tuning  First, I will ignore all aspects Vista related.  This Vaio has some nice power, a good feature set, and is one of the cheaper 17" that comes with an HDMI (an awesome feature if u download movies or have an hdtv.  However, its needs a serious run through on the physical design, especially around the keyboard.  The keyboard looks like it belongs on a 12 inch top.  though the actual buttons are large, there poorly spaced and arranged.  The entire keyboard has sooo much room around the edges that it begs the question "why didn't they use this space for the keyboard?".  The pros: Excellent speed/cost ratio Beautiful screen and 1080 HD HDMI  The Cons: The keyboard is TINY considering the real estate they could have used. The screen is so heavy, it requires one hand to hold the bottom down, while the other lifts the screen up. The screen has a 1 inch black bar all the way around that increases the overall size of the laptop.  I gave this 3 stars because it really has some nice potential, and any person who spends five minutes with it can see that it would be greatly improved with some minor changes.  But, its been reliable for me, powerful, and came at a good price.  In the end, you could do worse.	3.0	3.4470670223236084

for my parents  I bought this for my parents in their 80's so they could keep up with grandkids. I like the way it looked but it had a floating curser tthat I didn't know how to fix. I called and left a message with the phone number on the card in the box and also an email but I didn't receive any response from either one. My girlfriend knew how to fix this problem so I didn't need any more contact but was very disappointed that they didn't respond to me at all. The card said they wanted nothing but 5 star ratings and would do all they could to receive that. Can't give them that here.	3.0	1.984046459197998
Good machine; quality iffy  Pros: - Raw speed/performance - Size/weight - HDMI/USB ports - Screen brightness - Windows 7 full version  Cons: - Quality, quality, quality (or lack thereof) - Balance (machine tends to tip backwards) - Heat when used on lap - Screen glare in bright light/sunlight Other Thoughts: We actually own both the 1810TZ and a 1410. The 1410 is the "better" machine, although BOTH have suffered quality issues.  The 1410 had a loud fan (dislodged part), and it was nearly impossible to find a replacement (so we kept it). (On a related note, our newer 1810TZ has been a nightmare, with a broken "C" key, voltage regulator problem, and screen issues). Finally, the harddrive cable in both machines has separated from the clip holding it to the motherboard, requiring electric tape.  Not good.	2.0	2.1372179985046387

Stay away if you care about performance  Two stars because the hardware finish, keyboard, screen etc are great.  Only two stars because the performance sucks, big time. Forget about multi-tasking excel, powerpoint, 15 browser tabs etc. And I'm not even thinking about games. Vista sucks and so does the processor (Turion X2) on this laptop. Mostly runs at full CPU usage (sometimes the culprit is the sound drivers, sometimes svchost.exe).  I am a software professional and have not been able to tweak this enough to get decent performance i.e comparable to an old ACER laptop that had XP Pro. Did I say Vista sucks? It's pretty sad that a professional has to consider getting a gaming laptop to get decent application performance.  I have just resigned to using this as a glorified netbook because it is portable, has HDMI out for watching something on the TV and has enough storage.  Stay away, I bet your time is precious.	2.0	1.9601231813430786

Superb  I love this machine. Fantastic performance and gorgeous display at 4.3 pounds. Power and elegance together in one. The reflective screen is a real plus as well. Longer battery life would certainly be an improvement (I get just over 2 hours playing DVDs) but that's about the only negative thing I have to say so far. As far as the heat I do not see this as being a problem. My machine does not overheat - it feels a bit warm on the right undersurface but by no means hot - compared to my Averatech 3200 the Sony is a meat locker (you can fry an egg on the Averatech). As for noise the Sony is silent. Another plus for this laptop is the speaker volume. You can actually pump the volume up loud enough to listen to the soundtrack on a plane or a noisy airport without using earphones - every other laptop I've used or seen you'd have to put your ears right up to the speakers even on maximum volume. Three cheers for Sony and 5 stars for this gem!	5.0	5.146117210388184
Satisfied First-Time Mac User  Purchased the computer for my wife, with both of us coming from a purely Microsoft background.  We both easily made the transition to Mac OSX, and the computer ran more smoothly than I imagined (though I did purchase a third-party RAM upgrade and perform a self-installation... that's more for the future, though.)  Excellent laptop, and not even all that expensive once you consider comparable systems.  We expect this one to last us a long time.	5.0	5.142344951629639

Fun PeeWeee!  I have been using my Palm tx as a second internet device for a couple of years- it is great, but always wished the screen was just a little bit bigger and often wondered why  plam didn't make a slightly larger device- it is such a simple little thing- pops open quickly, etc.  When I saw the asus eee, I knew that it was exactly what I wanted.  Just big enough.  My tx still is good for lounging and just reading, but the eee can do a bit more.  I  will not add xp to it- I have an xp desktop and tire of the constant slowing down over time.  However, that does leave a few options out, such as using netflix watch now with the eee- would like to be able to hook this little thing up to my projector.  But that is only a slight disappointment. (BTW, you CAN use it with a projector- just can't use it to watch Netflix or Amazon Unbox.)  All in all, this is a great little computer- fast, quiet and capable of pretty much anything you can do on a bigger/windows based machine.  I upgraded it to the advanced desktop mode on the second day.  Was able to set up shared files, printers, etc with no problem- in fact setting up my Brother laser on the network was easier than setting it up with my older Dell notebook.  It just worked without needing to install drivers from CD.  Of course, the price was the main factor in just getting it as a secondary device- I know they will be selling the ones with slightly larger screen, but read that they would be closer to the 600 dollar mark and that is getting a little too pricey for what we want to use it for.  Get one.  You'll love it!	4.0	4.041442394256592
Linux users beware  I've had this laptop for around 18 months, and it is sufficient for what I use it for.  If you're looking for a primary system though, I'd look someplace else.  If you do purchase one, the first thing you should do is stick another GB of RAM in it.  The 1GB that it comes with really doesn't cut it, especially if you're going to run Vista on it.  I currently have Ubuntu 8.04 installed, and ran into 2 issues that anyone who intends to run a Linux laptop should be aware of.  First, the wifi card is an internal USB RTL8187b.  Yes, that's right -- internal USB.  This is unsupported in linux by Realtek, and the 8187 driver DOES NOT work with this card.  This also means that you can't just replace the wifi card with a supported chipset to fix the problem.  It's a proprietary design and is apparently specific to this laptop.  The only way to get the wireless to work is to use a Windows driver wrapper (didn't work on my distro), or compile your own patched driver.  Not a novice problem to solve.  Also, the wifi switch on the case is apparently software driven and doesn't function in linux (it's always on).  Second, the power management is flaky.  I didn't have Vista on it long enough verify whether it's an issue there as well, but the laptop consumes power even when off.  Not just in sleep mode, even when completely powered down.  Let the machine sit for a couple days and the battery is dead without fail.  I know there was a BIOS issue with the A105 that did this, but the A205s appear to be notorious for bricking during a BIOS flash.  I'm not going to try it.  All in all, you get what you pay for.  Toshiba apparently cut a bunch of corners to hit their price point on this one, so this is likely the last Toshiba I'll buy.	2.0	1.9602066278457642
Students, go for it..  If you are a student in school or college and on a budget, then DEFINITELY go for it. I am a PhD student in VirginiaTech and I was planning to get an HP notebook to replace my older HP. My advisor was a loyal Mac user and I decided to follow. I got this Mac and what the hell I was living with Windows. Microsoft mind programmed us to use Windows, Office and wait "stupidly" for the new "worse" Windows. Mac is a really new, wonderful world. Mine was bought last September 2007 so it came with Tiger OS not the latest Leopard. + The OS boots in seconds. Yes, this is not a typo, I mean seconds. +There is "NO" errors, hang ups, system faults, crashes or any other Microsoft crap. +The processor runs smoothly, the RAM is really sufficient, unlike the ever-hungry Windows. + The hard disk has no sound, vibration or any evidence of internal physical movements. + The ComboDrive does not have a tray that pops out with the lens, motors and everything, Instead the media is pulled in smoothly through the slot. + The BATTERY is REALLY INCREDIBLE. Four hours, again yes 4 hours is the least time to run with iTunes running, Safari browsing, iPhoto loading and typing in iWork. In light conditions you can go fr 6 Hours straight. Never happened with Windows. I say windows not a PC because I have noticed that Windows is the guilty one. On your PC you will always see the hard disk running, lighting up and down. Mac OS does not do any of these silly non-logic load.  The cons of MacBook are: -You don't have VGA output and the converter doesn't come with the notebook and you should then buy a miniDVI to VGA converter for $20. - You should only buy hardware like external drives or printers that says "Mac Compatible". - The white casing gets dirty "SO" quickly so make sure that your palms, wrists and fingers are clean.  Conclusion:: Go and get a Mac right now, you are mind programmed by Microsoft.  I took out a star for the White casing and for the built-in shared memory graphics card. If you are a Pro-gamer then you should pay extra money and get MacBook Pro	4.0	4.004873275756836
iLife  Great laptop.  Be aware though that, while Apple advertises that all new MacBooks come with iLife'08, those currently (as of 8/26/07) shipped by Amazon are still coming with iLife'06.

Great Specification, Poor Design Decisions  I read some amazing reviews of this laptop. The only one I found that had anything negative to say was S.K.'s review here on Amazon. And he's absolutely right. I also returned the laptop to HP (who offered me a $70 credit to keep it, take note). There are 3 basic design issues which, for me, make this laptop unusable.  1. Keyboard. The keys themselves are a bronze color and the key symbol is black. It makes it virtually impossible to see what the keys are. An unbelievably stupid design decision. Having read S.K.'s review, I thought that maybe the keyboard is back lit, thus making it easy to see which keys are which. The keyboard isn't back lit. Even with good over head light, the keyboard is very difficult to read. I know I tried.  2. Screen glare. Gone are the days, it seems, when laptops came with a readable, easy on the eye, matt finish LCD screen. This laptop, like so many I looked at, has a highly reflective plastic coating which completely covers the screen. Yes, it will protect the screen but the reflections it picks up from everything else to the sides and behind you  are incredibly distracting. If I'd wanted a mirror, I'd have bought a mirror.  3. Screen tilt. The screen does not lay completely flat like other laptops I've had in the past. This one goes back to about a 120 degree angle. I sometimes use an external screen with a laptop so need something which can lay flat and not get in the way of the external screen while I use the laptop keyboard in front of it.  Issues #2 and #3 I could maybe have lived with, but the keyboard issue was a deal breaker for me. A great pity because this laptop has a great spec for a great price. HP, what were you thinking?  I bought a Toshiba A305-S6916 instead. It has an almost identical spec to  the DV5-1250us. It too suffers with issues #2 and #3, but it was a little cheaper. The small saving will be used up buying an anti-glare filter for the screen. Not much I can do about the tilt. Oh well.	3.0	2.323652982711792

Great mobile workstation  I have owned just about every model in the Apple notebook line (except the 17" MacBook Pro) and I love the MacBook.  It's a great small sized package that is easy to carry with me where ever I go, yet it has the power I need to be able to open CS3 Photoshop, CS3 Dreamweaver, Pages, and several other programs all simultaneously to get work done.  Granted, if you want to play some of the more graphics intense games, this is NOT the machine you want. But I continue to use it by itself as well as connected to a 24" external display (when I need 1900X1200) and it does everything I need. I highly recommend getting 2GB of RAM as it does make a difference when using intense programs.	5.0	5.145284652709961
VERY HARD TO USE THE MIGRATION MANAGER  I get new macbook every 2 years and never had problems with the migration manager. For me,it is very imortant that I can move all my files to the new mac and in this case I am on day 2 and still can not figure it out....even thopugh I am a mac person and I know how to work with it....very well. I called apple support but they wore useless. I got everything they told me to, I did everything they told me to and there is still no way for the the computers to find eachother.... I called the apple store but I will have to leave both laptops for days in order for them to do it and I can not afford being away from my laptop due to work. I am getting a feeling that soon Mac will turn in to the new McDonalds, it;s getting too popular and the Apple people are getting too cocky these days....and without Steve Jobs.... Anyway, not recomending this product if you want to transfer your files from an old mac	2.0	1.8566032648086548
Great expectation.............  I purchased an Acer AS5810T and an Acer AS4810.  Both seemed to be exactly what I was looking for:  Great price, features, weight, battery usage (would have liked backlit keyboards).  In particular, I was anxious to see if their new battery hour claims were true.  The only good news is that they really will do 6-8 hours on a charge.  Unfortunately, everything went downhill from there.  The 4810's keyboard began to malfuntion within 2 or 3 days use.  Keys began sticking in the down stroke position.  I had to use a paperclip to lift the space bar and the "w" key back in their up position.  During set up with the 5810T, Acer directs you to burn a restoration set of disks in the event of a failure in the operating system.  The Acer software supplied to perform the task failed.  I contacted Acer support and was directed to download and install their recent patches.  Not only did their new patches end in a perpetual error message, they caused the overall machine to hang and/or crawl after their installation.  Maybe, in their rush to market, Acer prematurely released these machines without the proper testing of their software and hardware quality.  A real disappointment and a waste of many hours trying to get NEW machines to work.  With two out of two new machines disfunctional, I'd think twice before ever considering Acer.

I had have my MacBook more than a month ago. After one month, I turned my computer on and had white screen window..I mean nothing on it. So, I had it fixed. Now, I am worried about it. It gets  hotter in 2 hrs and worried about it getting ruin, explode or won't run.  Now , I wonder if I can get another MacBook and send this one back to Apple. It suppose to have one year warranty but trading it might not be acceptable. Also is anybody out there knows how I can resolve or prevent this laptop from getter hotter? I guess my comment and question.	3.0	3.020555019378662
I Almost Had to Return Mine  This is a lovely machine in most respects. I've owned laptops since 1985 and am not easily impressed, but the MacBook Pro elicited my admiration, at least until I tried to connect to my wireless DSL. The internal AirPort card recognized my 2WIRE DSL modem/router, but when I entered my security code, it wouldn't connect. Never had a problem with my Fujitsu Lifebook P2120. I even got a six year old ThinkPad running Windows 98 and a Linksys PCMCIA card to connect. After extensive research, I discovered from online forums that Apple's last software update to the AirPort card makes it impossible to connect with many wireless routers, not just 2WIRE's.  I purchased an Airport Express and connected it to my 2WIRE through their ethernet ports and the MacBook now connects wirelessly to the Airport Express without problems. Apple should aprise people about to buy a Mac about this problem.	4.0	3.759737968444824
Good, but not great  I read all reviews in Amazon for this product, and they all pretty much include all the pros and cons I found with my machine.  I first got a tx2120 to replace my old Acer 5050, since I have to attend several meetings at work, and I return to school--I thought a tablet PC will be a functional and efficient way to go.  I only kept it for 2 days after struggling with most of the programs I require for my job to work on a 64-bit Vista OS. I replaced it with the tx2110, and after working several issues with Vista  compatibilities, I got it to work.  After having it for three months, I think the product is not as good for the purposes it was designed.  I can not use it at job meetings or in the class at school because of the ridiculous loud noise it makes--very disruptive.  If the room is bright, the screen reflects a lot.  And as others mentioned, it gets steamy hot!  I hope I have kept my old Acer, which was as fast as the tx2120 or tx2110 (with only 1GB or ram), and because I paid for futures that are functional but very disruptive.  Since the tablet PC feature works great to its advantage, I give it a 3-star rating (otherwise it would probably a 1-2).  And HP's customer care is not the best, so be ready to make several calls, and maybe mail your machine to get it fixed.	3.0	2.9602110385894775
Looks good but not that good .....  Built in Camera doesn't work most of the times and I had to restart the system to get it back on again.  Second Vista looks great by this new OS crashed with a blue dump screen just second day after I got this laptop.	3.0	1.9889740943908691

Hello!  We used these laptops in my company for 6 years and we encountered the followings: From day 1 we head overheating issues. We did not use heavy stuff on them only word and firefox for internal company usage. The overheating where always there. The overheating problem was more manageable after we cleaned the heat-sink and added external coo-lings, but the problem was still there, but less frequently. After 6 years the company dumpd the laptops and gave it as a gift. I gave the laptop to my wife, who was only using it for Internet and candy crush. The laptop died after 3 months. Sum lifespan was 6years and 3 months. If somebody would want to buy the laptop i would advise against it.  Note: We had 8 such laptops, all laptops showed similar symptoms. There was a custom security firmware on them, but i would say that the overheating was independent from the firmware.	2.0	1.9743316173553467
nothing but problems  Since I bought this computer I have had it in for servicing more than anyone should expect. seems to crash or stop working for no reason and sony service can never explain why. Sony promised extras like a backpack and walkman which I never got. will never buy sony product again.	1.0	1.1805126667022705

I made a complaint that the lap top didn't come with a power pack and that I wanted to return the item, and I didn't get a reply.  I purchased this item from you and I still haven't gotten the power cord. Can you please provide me with such. I obviously would not be able to use the computer without the power cord. I also sent a message relative to such anomaly, and I have not even gotten a reply.  Today is September 27th some two months later. I went and bought a power cord for the item, and to my surprise the item doesnt even work. Amazon, look what dishonesty you've orchestrated against me! I would like to send the item back so I can get a refund. Amazon,are you listening? Am going to tell everybody about your conduct. I am also going to contact the better business bureau about this problem if I don't get any satisfaction.	2.0	0.9043008089065552
2 weeks into the switch  There was no reason for me to switch to a Mac product.  I've always have been intrigued, but XP was doing it for me day in and out.  My current Dell Latitude was on its way out and I wanted something high quality.  I couldn't find anything that comes close in build quality/finish to the Macbook Pro.  Asus makes some nice notebooks but I didn't want Vista, with all of its assorted issues and XP doesn't seem like a sound choice given its looming end of life.  So now I have my Macbook Pro.  As a software developer I was drawn to the idea of a UNIX shell as a first class citizen (sorry Cygwin).  The toughest part is learning the keys.  In XP I could move around an IDE effortlessly, with keys: home,end,ctrl-arrow etc.; not so on the Mac keyboard.  This proved the most frustrating.  The lack of the forward delete is also a disappointment but I hear there are keyboard mapping solutions.  I installed VMware Fusion and XP for initial comfort and to ease the transition off windows.  BTW, Fusion is amazing.  It feels like it's native, and it's definitely faster than XP on my current Dell.  With Fusion, I can map drives, cut and paste and access servers between the two -- it's all very fluid.  Full screen your Fusion in a different Expose window and you can quickly swap back and forth between Mac and XP.  Now the downside.  In the first few days I experienced no less than 4 crashes, where it had to be power cycled.  I haven't had any issues since, so I'm going to conveniently forget.  Firefox crashes still, but no more than it did on windows, and maybe less.  So in conclusion, Mac was the right choice for me.  High quality in and out and at a decent price.  The interface is pure eye candy and orders of magnitude superior (usability-wise) than XP.  While there will be some pain points in learning, it will hopefully be worth it.  Get VMware Fusion and install Windows for when there is no Mac alternative.  *UPDATE* I have now had the macbook pro for 2 months.  I'm really enjoying some of the UI features, such as expose and spaces more and more.  The hotkeys are awesome (e.g. show desktop, lock/start screensaver).  There are however a few recurring problems that I have been experiencing.  I'm going to detail the top two.  The first issue is the screensaver hotkey stops working at times.  This is a huge issue because it is also the mechanism for locking my computer, and I cannot leave my desk w/o locking it, so I must either close the lid (sleep) or restart, which fixes the issue.  Now for the second issue: often when I try and restart/shutdown, it does nothing, then a minute later tells me that Finder failed to quit and I should quit Finder then try again -- great suggestion Apple, given that you CAN'T QUIT FINDER!! So now I have to hold the power button down for 10 seconds to kill it or run "sudo shutdown -r now" from Terminal.  So in my latest conclusion, my mac is not living up to my expectations of reliability.  I was led to believe, by many in the mac community/stupid commercials, that Mac was the panacea from XP.  The Mac user interface is *unmatched* and that along with the UNIX foundation were and still are my original reasons for choosing Mac.  My previous XP Pro notebook however was significantly more stable.  The reliability issues are getting more and more annoying and I just hope Apple is able to resolve and restore my faith in their product.  Lastly, I would change the star rating to three but it won't seem to let me.	4.0	4.0755109786987305
U get what u buy it's old  Didn't expect much from this. Had it for about 8 months then the battery started expanding. Still works but I feel like it's gonna explode	3.0	3.0436277389526367
Product description is incorrect  The notebook does not support Hyper Threading (as given in many sites). I checked the Intel site for this processor and found that it does (or so I thought). Just to confirm, I downloaded Intel Processor Id utility and it reported that the processor does not support HT.    As is the case with most of the branded notebooks, the amount of tweaking that you can do on the system is highly limited. For example, you cannot even change any BIOS settings (except date time/parallel port info and set passwords). None of the advanced chipset features are available. And the BIOS is phoenix bios, which is not supported by most of the BIOS tweak tools that you can run from windows.    The cooling fan does make a lot of noise at times, but I have come to get used to that and unfortunately, you cannot control the fan speed through the power management tool (unlike the case in some other models).    The display is really good with high resolution. I am not into much gaming and all, so the 4X AGP does not make much difference to me.    A couple of things Sony could have improved upon was to put a 333 MHz memory instead of a 266 MHz one and provide a more versatile card reader (the card reader slot supports only Memory Stick Media. So if you want to connect your CF or SD card, you need an external reader.    But having said this much, I am happy with the system and it has not given me any problems so far.	3.0	3.792785406112671
Great Design, But Not Crazy About OS  This is a beautifully designed laptop in every sense.  It is compact, light, smart, and great looking.  The aluminum case is rugged and durable.  The magnetic power adapter is genius.  The keyboard is the most comfortable keyboard I have ever used.  The auto-dimming screen and keyboard lighting is awesome.  It is also extremely light for the size and comfortable to carry.  Quite frankly, for $2000 I would expect nothing less!  My problem is with the OS.  It supposedly has a reputation for not crashing, yet it crashed twice the first day I got it while trying to use Open Office (a program I used on my PC regularly with no problems).  Additionally, I've had problems with the Finder- I would click on "Go" - "Applications" or another menu choice, and the window would appear for a nano-second and then disappear.  Very buggy.  I had to restart to get this to correct itself.  Overall, the sturdiness and design is great, but I am unimpressed with the operating system.  Mac people have the perception that Windows crashes all the time, and that has not been my experience at all, and I'm actually having more trouble with Leopard than I have ever had with Windows.  That said, with the fact that no other company offers a laptop option that is as attractive in design as Apple, this was really my only choice, and I do not regret it.  It has been worth the minor inconvenience I've had so far and I must admit some aspects of the OS are pretty cool, such as the stacks feature.  Hopefully it stops getting buggy on me!  UPDATE:  Haha, two days after I wrote this review the backlighting on the screen broke and I had to return it.  I went back to PC and have been on my Sony Vaio ever since.  I bought a second one for my business a few months later and both have been running strong without a problem.  Both Vaios didn't even add up to the cost of a single Mac Book Pro and they actually had faster processors, more memory, and more storage.  After a faulty iPod Photo and Macbook I won't be trying Apple again.  I'm actually embarrassed that I got so wrapped up in their marketing and ignored my better sense on value versus price!	2.0	1.9604905843734741
Hub for your digital lifestyle  This is an amazing machine and here's why:  1. OS X(5/5): Rock solid and rarely has "issues" like its counterpart. No viruses, or spyware to speak of. Also, its more useable for average people. Two examples of this are WiFi and digital cameras. Here's my tutorial: plug in your digital camera and it will ask if you want to upload files; go to open wifi access point and, open browser. Done. Simple.  2. iLife(5/5): Has excellent useability as well: all of your media in iTunes, iMovie, iDVD, iPhoto are all interoperable and can be used together seamlessly. You will be making home movies in iMovie, grabbing a song from iTunes, and then maybe throwing in some photos from iPhoto with the greatest of ease!  3. Physical Characteristics(4/5): The 13" display is big enough to use without making the unit too big to carry around. The widescreen helps with desktop space. I will admit I'm not a fan of the white laptop but color is the least of my concerns when choosing electronics. The built in mic and camera are nice added feature for photoconferencing in iChat or Skype as well. It must be added the speakers are not very good and the other negative is no firewire 800 port/only 1 firewire 400 port. It runs a little hot but not burning hot. The keyboard is very nice as its not condensed like other laptops and typing is easy, almost like a regular keyboard.  Overall its a great machine and if you upgrade the hard drive and RAM on your own it can do most anything. Check out free apps for the mac like VLC(video), Monolingual(language remover), Limewire(filesharing) and Mac the Ripper(DVD decrypter) once you get this little gem.  UPDATE: My machine is still running great. I can run Dreamweaver, iTunes, Bittorrent and Photoshop all at once without crashes. Yes, it gets taxed a bit but its a lot better than my pc at work.	5.0	5.149084091186523
Macbook 1.83  I am thrilled with this computer.  It's my first laptop and what a kick!  I've had two Mac desktop computers and have always been a big fan of Apple computers.  The beauty and simplicity of design of may laptop is great.  The feel of the keyboard is excellent.  What can I say about OS 10.4?  If you know this system,  then you know that there is noting better!  Well, except for the upcoming 10.5, perhaps  Buy a Macbook and you won't be sorry!	5.0	5.143645763397217
if only I had smaller fingers  The eee does live up to the hype. It's cheap. The screen is small but sharp and definitely usable. The factory Xandros, on the internal solid state drive (SSD) usually boots faster than my XP laptop comes out of standby. Xandros is a fairly restricted fork of Debian, but I was able to put Ubuntu on a USB stick (with the help of the fine folks [...]) and can boot that when I need it. (I might put it on the SSD, but I dunno if I wanna give up that very-fast-boot option).  The only real problem I have is with the keyboard. One problem is the layout: e.g. Home and End are keychords (using the Fn key). The bigger problem is the keyboard's (small) size. I touchtype and have fairly big (aka normal-sized North American?) fingers. When I touchtype on my ThinkPad, I do so with a fairly low error rate. When I touchtype on my eee, I get a lot of errors. Solutions are  * external keyboard. I bought a $[...] USB keyboard with touchpad which pretty much solves the problem.  * hunt'n'peck. This works fine for when I'm out-and-about and just wanna check email or view some webpages.  * wait for the eee 900, which is 9" wide and has a correspondingly larger keyboard (and screen, with higher resolution). By comparison, this eee (aka the "eee 700") is 7" wide. Unfortunately this wasn't an option when I got this eee, and the 9" is also $[...] more.	4.0	3.373746633529663
Good Laptop, but not as polished as you'd expect from Apple.  This review won't focus on the Mac OS  and explain why it is so awesome.  Like Louis Armstrong said (about jazz), "if you need to ask, you won't understand."  The Intel chips are really fast, rest assured.  The glossy screen is glossy, but the colors are rich.  What really bothers me is how the quality control of the manufacturing is going downhill.  My Macbook (from Amazon, Black Friday sale) had several "build" defects.  There were some slight gaps along the left and right edge seams of the laptop.  The hard drive kept making "chirping" sounds-- it seemed like the heads were trying to park themselves sporadically... every 10-30 secs or so.  The plastic frame (or housing) around the LCD did not sit flush on the LCD Panel.  When seen from the sides, you can see gaps between the frame and the LCD panel.  This is probably my 10th Mac I've purchased in the past 12 years or so (in addition to countless Apple accessories).  I've also convinced friends and family members to buy at least another dozen.  No joke.  I am a die hard Mac fan.  And for good reason.  Design and build quality used to be a non-issue for anything Macintosh.  That was why you happily paid a premium (and for the OS)-- because everything (even the Newton) looked polished and well built and intelligently designed.  Titanium G4 Powerbook!  Remember when that came out?!  Made with real titanium!  Sigh, those where the days-- Apple didn't mess around.  Well, all I can say is that this latest Macbook quality is disappointing.  Aesthetically, it's a fine looking piece of hardware.  But like the drunk guy/girl across the room, when you get up close and personal, the warts begin to show.  Maybe it's because it's made in China, where the QC standards are harder to keep track of-- I'm not being racist.  I'm Asian, first of all.  Also, I'm a big fan of their food.  I'm just stating a fact.  None of my rock solid other Macs were made in China.  Plus I've seen pics of these huge Chinese mega-factory complexes.  They make Detroit assembly lines look like haute couture.  Bottom line:  I think Apple is cutting corners... sad to say.  It was inevitable... they've grown exponentially in the past few years.  Anyway, the good news is that Apple usually stands behind their product... although recently it only happens  after enough people get angry and make a fuss, heh heh.  To be fair, in the past I've only had one very minor problem and it was resolved without issue.  Like I said, Apple usually stands behind their stuff.  So, what's my conclusion?  It's a good laptop.  Would I buy it again?  Sure, but not as eagerly and only after I checked out one of those sub-$500 Windows notebooks that seem to be in every big box store in America.  Don't get me wrong, I would never buy said Windows notebook, but I'd check them out just to know that other options were out there...  it's good to be informed.  Anyway, I hope Apple will take care of these defects for me.  I'm with them for the long haul.  Still, there's one thing that really bummed me out about this latest Macbook purchase:  I missed out on the excitement of my "new Mac computer" high.  After all, that's the best part about buying a Mac.  Otherwise, we may as well run the Mac OS on an ugly generic Intel box.	3.0	3.0084261894226074
Almost perfect except for that keyboard.....  First, here's what was done right.  I can put the power cord in my pocket.  No laptop carrying case necessary.  This is brilliant.  Ctrl+Alt+T pops up console, and KDE's "konsole" program is just one command away.  80% of my time on this machine is spent using this one program.  It works perfectly out of the box.  Firefox (including all of the plugins I usually have to install manually) Just Works.  Wireless comes very close to "Just Works".  The simple connection software doesn't track wep keys per connection (that I've been able to figure out), and there are a few UI issues.  But "/etc/init.d/network restart" works as well as it always did.  The screen?  It's small.  It doesn't work well for google maps.  It works fine for everything else.  In short, this is a really, really impressive laptop.  And it has a bash shell.  That's about all I need.  Now let's talk about the keyboard.  It's small.  That's fine, I have small fingers.  Evidently, my typing style is such that I never use the right shift key, so that hasn't bothered me either.  The frustration comes from being able to hit a key (the worst offender is 'n'), feel it go all the way down, and not have anything happen.  This only happens when coming in from the corner instead of directly on the middle of the key, and doesn't happen all of the time.  But it happens often enough to really slow me down as a typist.  All of this may seem a little unfair -- this machine wasn't designed for 10-hour coding sessions, but that's what I use it for.  My error rate is (slowly) going down, and perhaps after a few iterations there will be a model with the smaller equivalent of the Dell QuietKey.  Until then, I'm keeping this one and (mostly) loving it, but I'm very reluctant to recommend it to anyone else who would be doing any serious typing on it.  If you're looking for a computer to do mostly quick web browsing and email, this is just about perfect.	4.0	3.378735065460205
Great Laptop with Major OS & Hardware Flaws  First off I love my Macbook because it provides more stability than my windows machines. For professional work it can't be beat as of this moment. Although it is more stable than my windows machines it still freezes, on average, twice a month. So it is not invincible like some fanboys would want you to believe.  Let me get to why I gave it a 2 out of 5 stars. WPA/WPA2 support is finnicky AT BEST. DUAL MONITOR support is wonky, unreliable and ultimately useless. Not addressing WPA issues is just ridiculous considering that it is something that can be fixed easily and why tout a miniport display that performs so poorly?  Everything else seems to work pretty well. I hope to update this review as soon as these problems are resolved.  Update: Maybe the WPA2 problems are only with certain routers as it doesn't have problems with our new Asus router. Within nine months the power adapter went to crap. Since it was within the 1 year warranty, Apple replaced it for free (it would have cost me $65 plus tax). I'm on my second external monitor cable and it is also giving problems now.  Update: About a month ago (2 & 1/2 years after purchase date) The monitor started glitching on me and now I experience the Blue Screen of Death every time I turn it on. Unfortunately, I don't have money to get it fixed right now. I am very disappointed that I'm experiencing these problems after paying such a high premium for this laptop. As far as Apple Care goes, I don't think it's right to pay so much extra for peace of mind when this expensive machine should be durable.  Update: The monitor problem is still here and I've decided NOT to buy a Macbook ever again! After paying over $2K for something that only lasted 2 1/2 years, I'm not willing to take that risk again. STOP VOTING ME DOWN! I've had a horrible experience and I'm just sharing my experience so others can make a better buying decision by taking my experience into account.	2.0	1.9642969369888306

Service is a disaster--I will never buy Sony again  You should be able to find good reviews of the computer elsewhere, so I won't go into that.  But I will share with you my nightmarish experience with their service.  About 6 months after buying it, I dropped the computer from a low height.  Totally my fault, though because it's a delicate machine it was damaged.  I've dropped Dells and Acers in my life and not had problems.  So I paid $800 to have them fix it at their repair center.  They did fix it, but they sent it back to me with a host of new problems.  The battery didn't work, the screen would flash unpredictably, etc.  It was unusable.  I called their support line (and suffered through the typical long wait) and they told me to send it back to their repair center.  I protested--I just did that, and I had to wait a week for it to come back, and when they did send it back it was broken.  Why would I do that?  But they told me I had no choice.  So I send it back.  They wouldn't charge me for it.  Guess what?  When they sent it back to me it was still broken!  I called them back to report the issue.  They want me to send it back to their support center.  Why, so I can wait a week to have them send it back to me broken again?  Every time I deal with their support people it takes 30 minutes and is very painful.  I will never buy Sony again.	1.0	0.9026769995689392
I Should've Bought a Chromebook.  This "refurbished" MacBook lasted me 5 months during a study abroad trip. I used it for the internet, Xcel spreadsheets, and writing papers... and then it died. I had to find a professional to save the hard drive to an external device because it never turned back on again. Not sure if this is just a poor job done by the refurbishing company, or if this model of MacBook is just too old to last. Either way, it was a waste of money and I should've just bought a Chromebook.	2.0	1.5899733304977417

It replaced a MacBook Pro!  I had a MC374LL/A MacBook Pro that supposedly had all the advantages. But Lion/Mountain Lion required too many compromises in certain key areas, the much vaunted HDMI compatibility was less than the dedicated PC out port our HDTV had, and a vintage Mac website had nothing but praise for Tiger on vintage hardware, especially when used in a period mid-2008 configuration. Seeing as how that fit in well with what I desired in a laptop, I exchanged the supposedly but not for me much better MacBook Pro for the older machine, bought a compatible version of Tiger, and started to explore.  Well, it turns out Tiger (since I have a G4 running Panther for Classic Mode) is everything it was made out to be. It's good enough for my needs, and the only thing I at all miss is the backlit keyboard. Everything else is the same or better on this model to the MacBook Pro, despite being supposedly such an older, inferior version.  There are software features I miss from Leopard/Snow Leopard, but the advantage of Tiger is it's a new experience compared to my sheltered Leopard/Snow Leopard experience.  Since .Mac/MobileMe has been replaced, there's no downside to Tiger, save for some convenience features Leopard has, that I can see.  I did get an MB063LL/A, just one that was rebuilt by the local MacAuthority from an MB062LL/A logic board (i.e. Mid 2007 high-end white version transplanted into a black case save the hinge mounting, which was white).  It, with 10.4.11 mid-2008 Tiger and 10.6.0 period mid-2009 Snow Leopard, does everything the MacBook Pro did except keyboard backlighting and does things in a new and refreshing way with Tiger-a key point is Front Row. While Leopard and Snow Leopard focus on the deeper levels of Front Row and their beauty, Tiger features an awesome entry screen and with 4GB of RAM like the MacBook Pro, it's so awesome I don't really miss the MacBook Pro, except for while it was modern with it's period software, which was long since past.  If you want a great experience, and don't want to spend more money for a newer version of the same thing, with the caveat that your Internet needs may be more intense than period mid-2008 Tiger can handle, I recommend picking up one of these puppies.  Or the related MA701LL/A MacBook, since the Core Duo models are to be avoided.	5.0	4.463889122009277
Snappy, "relatively" reasonably priced laptop  While windows laptops bottom out at less than $500, price reductions have nudged this machine generally under the $1000 mark, and this particular model comes close. And it's probably a very reasonable amount, considering the features. What mates this model different?  - If you've done the full installation, you can use both windows and Mac US, doubling the of applications available to you. - The speed is very fast for most applications, and standard use will provide a near-instantaneous use.  And there are a few things that you may want to know before buying:  - For demanding streaming video like Stage 6, you will need to upgrade the RAM from 1 to 2 gigs. Extra modules are available for under $50, and installation is remarkabably easy. Two gigs is your limit  for total RAM. - Heat is an issue for a number of users; certainly a cooler system increases wear. But at default, this model can be quite warm. That, too, isn't a major concern. The freeware smcfancontrol can bring the temperature to under 100F without significant fan noise. - Previous versions of Mac portables have been less than impressive from the standpoint of graphics quality. Ib this 13" model, however, color is bright and and has very good detail. However, if you reduce brightness through the Control Panel, the image quality is close to a desktop system, and watching DVD movies is a pleasure. - This model has a battery life of well over four hours, though I try not to use the plug unless necessary. Save the battery entirely by uninstalling the battery.  These tips help make this Macbook a special pleasure to use.	5.0	4.043139457702637

This is the first laptop I have ever purchased that didn't have an accurate description. I usually use Ebay and if there is a problem with the screen having scratches it will be listed in the description so there is no surprises. This one did not	1.0	1.9848451614379883

Great computer but runs too hot!  The best computer I've ever bought. It's gorgeous and fun to use. I am actually proud to use this computer. I used to have a Dell and I hated it. My Dell looked like a brick and was full of spyware and viruses.  It's a great feeling to never have to worry about viruses or spyware.   I miss the right and left click mouse buttons though. Not sure why the Macbook just has one button. And the computer is very uncomfortable on my lap because of the heat. I usually have to place a towel underneath it. I would give it 5 stars if it did not heat up like a furnace on my lap.  I definitely recommend purchasing this computer, if you are a PC user and are fed up with viruses and spyware. You won't miss the PC after about 2 months of using the Macbook. Join the Mac side. it's worth it!	4.0	4.04052209854126

Does not burn cd's with itunes, difficulty connecting to dial up and little battery time..  In general a good laptop, but has a few problems. First it has a firmware problem that doesn't let you burn cd's with itunes (when you try you get a 2131 error message) and the people at toshiba have not shown any intention of solving it (dell laptop using the same drive had this problem but dell solved it months ago). Also the modem doesn't seem to work right, when trying to connect to dial up i have to uninstall it and then re install it in order for it to connect. no solution from toshiba either. also battery life is lousy (about one hour in power saver mode). So if you are an itunes user, are planning to use dial up or use your computer on the move, this laptop is probably not the best computer for you. Other than that it is a good computer for non advanced users.	2.0	1.9635400772094727

missing ILIFE 08 software  Although the laptop itself is great I do have 1 issue. The technical description states that this laptop comes with ILIFE software including garage band pre loaded.

Had To Return It , But The Merchant's Customer Service Was Awesome...  The Computer had so issues being a used unit...we tried to fix...I believe that it could have been fixed, but my time, and need of a computer was short...I got a full refund...Again, these were good people...if I had more time then, It would probably have worked.  Service Was Over-And Above...Thanks everybody.	2.0	1.9912828207015991
After 1 week of use  I bought this from Amazon and it has 1 week of use now. Yerterday i see the screen has a problema. The plastic frame border on the bottom of the screen is detaching off. You can even see the glue they used to put the plastic frame on top of the screen. I noticed this happens because it get real hot in that part. Its exactly on the botton where the "acer" name is. Its the hottest part of this laptop. Its strange that since most laptops get hot on the bottom where batteries are. Well on that part is so hot that the glue melted and the plastic now leaves an open space between the LCD screen and the frame. Im really pissed off, this laptop has 1 week and this should not happen. I have used it allot, but always plugged into my desk. This should not happen after 7 days of use. Even a basic quality test should have detected this. And im with air conditioner in the office all the time so i cannot imagine how it would look if not. The whole plastic frame would melt. I know it will eventually melt the whole glue and it will come off. Luck it has 4 screws on each border so that will hold the glass on place. I cannot give this back since im outside the US and it costed me 100$ shipping. It has 1 year warranty but I would have to pay 100$ to ship it back and then again 100$ to receive the new one. So thats half of the cost of this laptop. I knew this was cheap and now you all know why. This will happen with all laptops of this model i suppose since when im mean that it gets hot there it really does, so that melts the glue which they used to put it together. I have an Acer 17 LCD which works excellent after 4 years of use, that why i went with Acer again. The screen on this laptop os beatifull, and it has tons or Ram that why i give it a 2 star. I don't thing its acceptable that this happened after 1 week, even when its only the plastic frame on the screen which should not affect the laptop dirt will get into that place and then i can trow this away. Nice 650$. Im sure this will not last me 1 year since if after 7 days this happens i don't give this laptop to much to live. Now you know why its so cheap, because its cheap build. Im sorry for Acer since i will never buy a product from them again. Next time I will go with my feelings and buy a Sony or HP. This was suppose to for work and I use computers for 10 hours straight a day so im sorry that i did not went with something of more quality.  Update May.  Besides that problem i mentioned the laptop rocks for the price. The plastic frame that holds the screen did not dettached further, only under the "acer" band but not allot. Gladly the plastic frame did not detached more, it seems that is where the screen gets the hottest point. The laptop is hot. Thats stil there. I will get a laptop cooler and I advice everyone that wants to use this for daily use for several hours does this. You cannot use it on bed or over the legs so hot it gets. Even my left hand when i type feels the heat coming from below. The heat i so intensive when you move it out of the table its still hot for a while where you left it. I don't care to much about but im sure thats why the LCD melted, since the glue that they use to paste the plastic on the frame is probably not make for such much heat.  Besides that the laptop rocks. I got like 3 or 4 blue screens a day but I found the problem. I thought it was the head but was Google Chrome. Other people mentioned this problems as well, so i uninstalled Google Chrome and no blue screens since then. Wifi is good. Overall i would give this a 3 and half star, but for the price i got it 650$ is a sure buy.  The colors are amazing, this is always increible in Acer since I also own a 17 LCD that is still going after 5 years.  I recommed this product but get a laptop cooler for it. Battery is also good. I got a logitech VX nano mouse as well.	2.0	2.015455961227417

POOR LAPTOP, OK DESKTOP  I bought this 16 months ago for my daughter who was going off to graduate school. Within a couple of weeks she was complaining that it ran very hot and had very poor battery life. A few weeks after that the hard drive began to make funny sounds and then the computer would not boot. Tech support at ASUS said that she should send the computer in for service and that the turnaround would be more than a week. She did not have the luxury of not having a computer for that length of time as much of the course material was being presented online. She goes to school three hours away, so I drove to her school and switched out her computer for an older laptop that I had. I ordered a new hard drive, installed it and restored the computer to its original state, and I thought that was the end of it. But a few weeks later, the computer was freezing multiple times a day, and she had to reboot each time. She then informed me that she was so frustrated that she bought a MAC! I updated the drivers and removed all the software except the OS and it no longer "froze". I have been using this computer ever since with minimal software loaded at startup, and it seems to be working. I also use it to play DVDs and it does a good job of that. After a year of use, my comments are:  It has a very short battery life, one hour at best. . It does run hot which I attribute to the i7 processor and the fact that this is a laptop. As I write, the processor is 58 C or 136 F with very little running.  The keyboard is very odd. When I am typing, the cursor will "jump back" to an earlier point and I will be typing within previous text. I have used perhaps a dozen different laptops over 15 years, and I have never seen anything like it. While writing this review, this has happened more than ten times!  The computer is very fast.  The computer is heavy and has a large footprint.  In summary, it is a better desktop computer than a laptop. It has plenty of procesing capability, but very poor battery life, and a quirky keyboard which make it unusable as a laptop. Furthermore, technical support was useless. If you really want support and your work is important, you need to buy an upgraded maintenance plan.	2.0	1.950576663017273
MacBook Pro Review  I have been waiting for a year for an Apple laptop with a LED screen that fit within my budget.

Toshiba's design's problem  1. system is too hot, but some people happy if they stay in the Alaska 2. In the fist week, there are 5 tims of screen hang after system resume back if re-open the cover. I wrote a MS power point file for presentation to customer in my cubicle then closed the cover of notebook and brought it to conference room. The system is no screen anymore after I open bck the cover. I had to reboot my system and my PPT file was gone. I don't want it will be happen again, so I return it. 3.

I love you Amazon.com.  Hell & Worst Buy not so much *Sigh*  I bought this baby the same day I was going to get ripped off/tricked by someone into buying one of their old laptops. I figured why get an old one when can get a brand new one for the same price with more hard drive space.  When I opened the box I was pleasantly surprised to see my brand new jet black inspiron 1526 with all those wonderful specs, sans the video card (I don't play games on my laptop much anyway so not a problem.) It and Vista worked great, especially because every piece of hardware that I had (mouse, printer, digital camera, cell phone) all were compatible with Vista.  3 Months later I get an error code that will not allow me to log onto my computer. I figured the nice people at Dell would help.  They gave me a hardy *BLANK* Off, go to the retailer that you purchased the laptop from for help.  I go to Best Buy who wanted to back up my files for $90? ahmm how bout no. (Best buy didn't have a warranty option on the website when I purchased it) They sent it to get "repaired" under the dell warranty.  Dell had it for a week, did a diagnostics check, sent it back to me with an A OK!  Got home,  STILL COULD NOT LOG ON!  I had to split the drive into 3 partitions, re-install Vista on a second partition, in order to access all my files.  Then burn them on disks for safe keeping while I formatted the entire hard drive and reinstalled all the drivers myself and put back all my files.  2 Months later. Sitting listening ( the speakers aren't great at all. But plug some headphones in and turn it up you'll be partially deaf for a minute or so) to a CD in the laptop while browsing, BLIP system shuts down won't turn back on.  Take it back to best buy. They send it out for another week.  Diagnosis...  Mother Board burned out (after 5 months). I'm hearing its a common problem with the 1526.  Dell fixed that.  I get my laptop back from Worst Buy WITHOUT my CD. My calls have not been returned by Hells repair people or Worst Buy.  I would give this laptop a low 3.  A 2.9 if possible.  When its good its good, but when its bad it REAL bad.	3.0	1.969579815864563

I don't know why so many people bashing lenovo for?  first of all, I don't own any Lenovo brand product, but I bought 3 (or 4, depend on your definition) Thinkpads when they were under Lenovo's management. I decide to write this review to shed some lights (or some truth) based on my humble opinion.  1. there is someone pointed out that Lenovo charges too much for this spec. it should be more like 500 dollar or 600 dollar computer. how does that reviewer feel about Sony? Apple? what i'd like to say is there is more to a computer than just CPU, RAM, and HDD. I spend 1800 bought my Compaq notebook with full aluminum top cover while the similar spec DELL cost at most 1200 at that time. I didn't regret a bit as that extra protection really helped that computer survive all my college years with all the dropping and throwing, and it still full functional today after all those abuse unlike my friend's DELL which are out of duty years ago. The same experience made me spend another 2k on a Lenovo thinkpad T61p. I accidentally stepped on my thinkpad a couple of times (i weight 190 lb) and there has been no damage to this solid build machine whatsoever. do a search and you will know why lenovo spend so much money on that magnesium alloy case and roll-cage while DELL or ASUS just use some cheap plastic. By the way, rating a product one star without even owning one is utterly irresponsible. 2. Lenovo service is something i am quit surprised when i see people have bad experience with. I had a three years old T40 with a keyboard key get came out (they are not re-attachable), one phone call and a brand new keyboard shipped to me using next day shipping with no question asked. I also bought a X61T for few days and returned (due to disappointment to Intel's graphic card) for a full refund with no question asked. my friend's thinkpad, which he brought in HongKong 3 years ago, couldn't start up and send in repair to Lenovo U.S. and get fixed within a week and didn't cost a thing. overall, i am pleased with their service, and i am not saying this without a comparison. 3. to the reviewer who damaged his/her notebook because of hot water get in to the system. it is NORMAL for manufacture to decline their warranty because of it unless you purchase the 'accident insurance' or something. my friend knock out a cup of milk on her 3 day old Dell and Dell ask for 600 dollar for that. 4. again, i just want to give some of my opinion. after owning Compaq/HP, Lenovo, DELL ASUS. i would rate DELL's customer service to be the worst, Lenovo and HP is on par with each other.	3.0	0.9166638851165771
not worth it at any price  Over the years I have purchased more than 25 Dell computers for work and home. Michael Dell had turned the company around. It's in a nose dive again dealing with Dell is a daunting experience.  All laptops have some bells and whistles you can buy but when you start personalizing you can easily double the price.  I always had warrantees and they always worked.  Now I need one for the machine, one for software and one for accidental damage.  I am not sure if my firing a 9mm slug from a Glock 19 into my XPS 810 would be considered accidental but I was overwhelmed by 64 bit and Windows 7.  I think you would do much, much better shopping right here on Amazon and looking at Toshiba, Asus, Acer, Sony and maybe another brand (other than HP). Oh, anyone want a slightly used XPS810 desktop with almost everything you need to lose your mind.	2.0	1.9623304605484009

User Friendly  and loaded with "Work to Play" features  I've had the 1205 (not touchscreen) for 6 weeks and I love it-although I am an academic, this is the first laptop (actually, notebook)I've ever liked enough to transport. Its lightweight and high performance, and uncharacterisitcally, I even like the design of the touch pad and  keyboard and find it conducive to typing. I've also really enjoyed the media functions, including the DVD player (no problems)-the swiveling screen is great, and it even burns DVDs. The funtions are intuitive and user-friendly, and I've been inspired to sample many web resources that I had ignored-with the built-in Wifi, you can access web-based TV and movies anytime and anywhere. Thumbs up!	4.0	5.14559268951416
MacBook Pro Review  Great computer found at a great value. The only problem is that the battery dies very quickly once unplugged.

Turns out, I hate Macs?  Just in case you are wondering, are Macs really better? You don't really see the appeal, but if so many people love them, surely there's got to be something to that? For me - No.  I've had a hate/hate relationship with this since I got it. It's got the most passive aggressive operating system I've ever had the displeasure of using. It's my way or the high way, which leads to ridiculous design decisions like not having folders, which are *navigation items* above files. Fine if you're at home, but I'm actually trying to use it at work, where there is a huge labyrinthine folder system which Finder really can't handle. No really, it cannot find files that inside the folder I am searching, and frequently takes half a minute or longer to display folders with a large number of files. The only good thing about this, is I'm more familiar with the command line, given that I end up using grep to find everything. Seriously, I use the command line more often than I did on Ubuntu or Debian (Linux distributions). Then there's the wifi, which frequently thinks it's lost the password to my wifi connection when it's gone to sleep, forcing me to log out and in again, or if I'm lucky, close all browsers and other wifi using programs, turn wifi off, and then on again. And yes, there are less programs for Macs. And yes, I'm forced into a few apple standards, like Itunes which, well - I hate (should have been a clue for me really).  Finally, while I have a few more complaints, I think the kicker is... It literally causes me pain.  Whose bright idea was it to have an aluminium case? In winter, in a dry climate, it gives me several static shocks a week. Twice a day if I'm particularly unlucky. In that time, while starting a new job, I entertained frequent fantasies about dropping it out my 9th story window. I've never hated a gadget so much. Our antagonism has diminished, and my venom may seem overblown, but - literal pain. The Finder. In something I end up using for the majority of my day.  In a couple of years, I don't know what laptop I'll get, or what operating system, but I can tell you it won't be a mac. And when this does finally die, and I've scavenged its working parts, I look forward to the satisfaction I will receive from throwing it from a large, large height.	2.0	1.9547646045684814
slow laptop  I am not very happy with my dell 600 laptop, it is very slow in responding, in searching for a site, playing a video, or searching for anything, it takes so long that I just want to turn it off. I bought it because I thought the price was good, light weight and I thought finally I would have a laptop that I can afford.   I can always change my review of it if you thing you can give me some tip of how I can get it to speed up a little cause, maybe I am doing something wrong or I should not do.  - Jacob-	2.0	1.981009840965271

Black Screen Strikes Again!  I bought a Toshiba Satellite A210/A215 Series laptop little less than two weeks ago. Let's just say it's going back this Monday. Like others here who have laptops from the Satellite A210 series, my screen randomly goes black while the power appears to remain on. Moving the mouse, hitting the keys, doing ctrl + alt + delete does nothing. Only a hard restart works. I can't say I'm a computer expert, but going by the other reviews, it seems Toshiba has built a faulty product. Considering my much older laptop, which lasted me four years, never went to the black screen of death, I can't imagine why this new, and semi-expensive product would be so fatally flawed. A laptop shouldn't go to black screen the first day you get it! Perhaps it's overheating (even though I have a fan underneath), perhaps the brand has faulty components...I don't know. All I know is I now have to be burdened with bringing this back and getting a different brand. It's a shame because otherwise the laptop is great, and from what I hear Toshiba was considered by many to be a good brand. It seems "WAS" is the keyword. I recommend that people don't buy this laptop until Toshiba fixes this major flaw.	1.0	0.9067135453224182
Quite simply, the best in the world.  Don't be afraid of taking the step and getting an Apple notebook.  The other ones aren't worth it.  I've had a Dell and a Toshiba, and both have failed me.  I don't even want to mention my grandma's HP.  Powerbook is quite simply the best.  Its design blows the mind, with no little doors or anything that could get caught on something.  The Apple Experience starts when you open the box.  Its incredible.  Apple is the BMW of computers.  Its beatiful.  When you finish calibrating the battery the way they say, you're ready to have fun.  The apple logo lights up in back.  You don't notice it, you're having so much fun.  A plenthora of the latest ports (Apple didn't bother with the old ports nobody will use), you can hook up your USB 2 and Firewire devices.  Inside Apple has given you the best software.  Dell will load your laptop up with cheesy shareware software, where you have to buy it after 15 days.  Apple gives you the finest--included.  iLife 04 with iTunes (manage music), iPhoto (manage photos), iMovie (edit movies), iDVD (make DVDs), and GarageBand (MAKE/edit music) blows away any software from the Windows world.  OmniGraffle is a really cool drawing program, and GraphicConverter is a great graphics program.  Mail, iCal, Address Book, Safari, and the other built-in apple programs are very nice.  Safari is better than Internet Explorer for browsing, and Mail is far nicer than Outlook Express.  Worried about not having enough software for Mac?  Forget it.  There's piles of high quality stuff for Mac.  There is literally nothing you can do on a PC that you can't do on a Mac, often far better.  Even with games, where the Mac is slightly lacking, you can get Command and Conquer, Warcraft 3, Myst, Age of Empires, and many more popular titles.  Mac OSX was rated the best operating system according to PC World magazine, and its not hard to see why.  I was smitten.  You will be smitten too.  Mac simply don't get viruses, spyware, and randomly crash right when you're writing the most important report of your career.  This is probably one of the biggest pluses.  No more blue screen of death.  The built in wireless was a great plus.  When I plugged in the mac, it found our wireless network instantly.  Did you know, we had not been able to figure out how to do file sharing with our PCs.  We plug in the mac, and it found our other PCs right then and there.  I was file sharing in minutes!  The backlit keyboard is sooo cool.  Its automatic, and it is just stunning.  Watching DVDs is great.  The battery actually lasts long enough to finish the movie, and the controls aren't fussy and impossibly tricky.  There's no CD tray.  Its a slot-loading drive (see picture in product description)  Overall, you can really tell someone was thinking when they made this computer.  What a winner!  I don't want to sound like a salesperson, so there are some cons:  -Won't run your windows software.  You will have to look around for some replacements.  Most of the commonly used stuff is built right in, so you can read (and create) PDFs, manage your digital stuff, get mail, surf the web, read Word documents, and much much more.  You may have to find some more specialized programs for Excel and Powerpoint files, Graphics editing, etc...  -ummm.....  -The mouse has just one button  -umm.....  -Mac OSX takes a little getting used to, but then you'll figure it out after a day or two  You will be sorry if you choose to buy a Wintel (Dell, Compaq, HP, Gateway, Sony, etc...)notebook.  When you spend the first 10 hours after you buy your computer on tech support, you will remember this review.  You have been warned.	5.0	5.1488494873046875
Bitter experience. Expensive too!  I almost forgot about this order, found it accidentally when searching my Amazon purchases, but I still remember the bitter lesson I learned - not to buy second hand computers anymore. The computer I received turned out defective and very dirty, somehow I negotiated a replacement, which worked for just 3 months. The price I paid to Apple to fix was $1100.00:  they found the display was replaced with some third party display, the logic board was messed up, the upper case, the keyboard, the HDD, one ribbon cable, the super drive was not functional...just a computer piled from random parts. I paid the price and later I fixed more things to this computer, for instance Apple's labor turned out not perfect too, they did not assemble properly the new display which I fixed later myself. This computer still works and I gave it two years ago to a friend who can not afford to get a new one. At least I learned how to diagnose and fix macs.	1.0	0.9051185846328735
Not Refurbished - Dumped But Soon Useful  I am writing this to make the potential buyer aware that things are not always the way they are advertised.  Do a little online homework before you purchase and ask lots of embarrassing questions.  I normally do this but being in a hurry has cost me.  Having never owned a Notebook not Laptop as advertised, I really knew very little about them other than what the seller told me.  Being in a hurry and just wanting something for word processing I purchased what I thought was a computer that had been inspected and repaired to satisfactory condition:  everything was supposed to be working.  What I got was altogether different.  My computer was running very hot but I was told by my friends that was normal.  When the battery died and the charger went out I decided to do a little upgrading.  Having assembled my own desktops and towers at home, I figured it would be easy.  I went online and got the manuals from Dell and then began inspecting the computer.  I discovered that the internal fan was not working and probably never has since the heat is the same today as it was when I got it.  I found a hinge that was bent and the covers keep popping loose at that corner.  I suspect the heat sink to be broken so I have ordered a new fan, heat sink, battery, and charger to replace the defective parts.  I have also ordered a memory upgrade and will soon do the same for the CPU and Hard Drive.  I found a new cover through Amazon with hinges to replace the damaged hinge and the deeply dented top cover.  When fully functional the D600 Latitude is a handy piece of equipment and I have already put it to work creating teaching plans for work.  If you do not know how to repair or upgrade computer components, be careful about what you buy and who you buy it from.  This one is a serious fixer-upper but all-in-all I am glad to have it.  It works but soon it will be doing just about anything my tower can do.  Internet with Wi-Fi, dial up and DSL are all operational and the DVD player reads and writes my CD has and plays my DVD Movies and Instructional Videos.  With Windows XP Pro, MS Office, and Virus Protection, I am confident that I will eventually use it long enough to get my money out of it and then some.  Why did I wait so long to write about this since I bought this in November, 2011?  After several months of use, I completed my initial work and downloaded it to a flash drive to use in my desktop.  Being uncomfortable to use in its current state, I put the notebook away until the need arose for me to use it again, about 10 days ago, and that is when I made my discoveries.  I could understand a battery dying on me on the shelf but not a fan, battery charger, or a heat sink.	3.0	3.662578821182251
Limited, but useful  This is a great little computer, fast, easy to use, and best of all, small enough to use in contexts where one wouldn't want to schlepp something larger. The Linix operating system is almost invisible under a good Windows-like graphical user interface that's easy to use, and the provided software handles most standard tasks well and with Windows/Office compatibility (and in most cases faster). The small keyboard takes getting used to, but does work. There's a good support network out there; I easily found and installed an application that turns off the rather noisy fan.	4.0	4.018693447113037
Keyboard is ridiculously hard to see  I purchased this laptop about a month ago.  It's quite accpetible as laptops go, but it has one glaring flaw, which affects all of the bronze colored HP laptops.  The Keyboard is ridiculously hard to read unless you have a very bright light directly overhead.  There just isn't enough contrast between the white letters and the bronze keys to be able to see them.  Touch typing is fine, until you need to find a special key (PgUp, PgDn, Insert, Delete, etc...).  It's extremely frustrating.  I'm actually looking through the HP parts store to see if I can find a black keyboard with white letters to replace this with (It would look horrible, but at least I could read the keys).	2.0	1.9574700593948364
FROM A WINDOWS USER.  GRADE A FOR MAC OS, A for cpu, B+ FOR HARDWARE  Update : My first Mac has gone from being a secondary laptop to being my primary laptop.  Mainly due to the excellent OSX and Safari web browser, which beats Windoz and IE hands down. I've become more proficient with Macs.  What I HATE about the Macbook(and also a 17" Powerbook I bought to play around with) is that these things COOKS- an egg!  Flip it upside down and they work as George Foreman grill and you can fry burgers on these.  Updating to 10.5 Leopard is even more demanding.  In Summer I wonder if the laptop is heating up the room more.  It makes the Macs feel inefficient and even (undeservedly) low tech and unreliable. I hope they use better cooling and one of those centrino or whatever comes up next cooler running processors.  Sometimes I wonder if the white plastic casting will melt.  It hasn't but it has turned yellow at the track pad, palm rest etc where in comes with contact with human skin.  This is a manufacturing defect and Apple has acknowledged it and fixed the issue on later White Macbooks.  They offer a free replacement (the palmrest etc only) for the earlier Macbooks IF it is still under the one year warranty.  Well, I  didn't know about this so I missed the deadline .  While most Macbooks are quite problem free, there are many other issues with reliability with the Macbooks and Macbook Pros you can easily find online with a search.    x  x  x My first Mac. Switching is like learning to drive a right hand drive car.  A little frustrating at times but the MAC OSX is Very well designed and intuitive and user friendly.  The upcoming Windows Vista looks a lot like a MAC OS.  If you're new, your local store can offer help if you have questions. I also signed up for Pro Care. $99/year .  Also bought .Mac for $99 (or family pack for $179).  When you buy it, it is so nice to carry that box in your hands.  PROS: Security.  Virus, spyware etc are rare, almost none.  STABLE. Hard to crash. Especially if you're doing video editing, 3D computer modeling and animation etc.  Pros all switched to Macs now.  Once you go Mac you don't go back.  FAST.  USER FRIENDLY. Simplicity.  Most Mac users love their Macs.  Some very smart little touches.  Very responsive interface.  Computer starts fast. Programs starts fast.  iMovie HD is nice for doing simple hi def HDV editing(upgrade to Final cut express or final cut pro), iphoto a little too basic but ok for digital photo work(upgrade to Photoshop or Aperture), Garage Band is fun and quite versatile if you're a musician, iSight camera is fun for a short while but I hardly use it, good for iChat perhap.  Motion sensing Harddrive!  Prevents damage from sudden movements/ drops of the laptop.  My Sony topend laptop dropped merely one inch on the desk and needed a new harddrive. Not with the Mac.  CONS : No word processor! Throw in that word processor darn it.  It comes with a 30 day trial of Apple's own 'Pages' and you can buy MS Word or any other software you want.  It does come with a very basic Text edit.  Laptop gets hot. Thats why they call it notebook now cause you'll heat your laps, esp when plugged in to ac/dc.  The new GLOSSY Screen is BRIGHT and SHARP with great COLORS. But the Blacks are are not really true black except from certain viewing angles. This is not obvious viewing text. But only when you use a screensaver with a lot of black(which Apple cleverly avoid putting in the system) or viewing DVDs or editing photos.  Most laptops under $1000 are like that except a few premium ones like my other laptop with an x-black screen(on select Sony models) and the blacks are just black and watching DVD's, editing photos are fantastic.  On the Macbook it's just not bad.  Texts look good.  That's a shame because Mac users are often working with graphics.  Macbook PROs are better but at $2-2.7K.  ***Tip : You can increase or decrease text size easily by pressing the Apple button and + or - key. How convenient.  Touchpad is large but marginally less responsive if you're used to moving your finger fast. Also it has only one button instead of two like on PC laptops makes it less convenient. But someone on Amazon told me you can go to system preferences>keyboard & mouse>trackpad and enable two finger on trackpad for secondary button.  Magnetic Macsafe power adaptor is nice.  One of the softest sounding built in speakers on the market! I guess they expect you to use either headphones or external speakers. But bring on less wimpy speakers next time please.  NO PCMCIA or PCIexpress slot.  Can't use Verizon Wireless Broadband etc cards. Need Macbook Pro for these(and they use the new PCIexpress, not PCMCIA. Airport(wifi) works great but is not truly mobile.  $200 for a DVD burner upgarde when Dell charges only $50 for upgrade to DVD burner AND a 20GB HD. DVD burners don't cost more on Macs than on PCs.  Another $200 for the Black instead of white shell. Overpriced!  $1099, $1199, $1299 seems about right for the 3 Macbook models. Or throw in some iPod shuffle or nano with those models.  SOLID body but easiy scratched. I always protect mine with a case.  Battery life = a full 4 hrs!  You'll see mac guys using no extention cords often while PC notebooks struggle with their 75 mins.  Also very accurate battery meter compared to PCs!  Software updates takes awhile to download.  Can't they just sell the CDs at the stores or by mail for a coupla bucks ?  I heard the next OS Leopard is going to be faster and better optimised for the Intel core duo.  Did I say fast for video editing?  To my surprise it is similar in speed to the Pro models!  Even in HiDef mode(HDV).  The Macbook PRO models are great for gamers with the seperate graphics card.  But since i'm not too much a gamer , I don't need it.  I HOPE APPLE MAKES A MACBOOK IN 15.4 INCH OR EVEN 17"  SCREEN(aluminium or plastic case)PRICED LESS THAN MACBOOK PRO.  [I also put in a 1gb ram(a must for video editing), it is easy to do yourself. Just search Yahoo/google. Take out the battery, unscrew a metal cover and push a lever firmly and quickly to remove the 256mb ram.  1gb+256=1.25Gb ram works fine(don't have to be 512+512mb). Thousands of us have 256mb rams sitting around going to waste. ]	4.0	3.4422311782836914
This MacBook comes with OS Lion Pre-installed  NOTE: This MBP comes with OS Lion pre-installed, not the OS Snow Leopard as described on the product page.  I purchased it on Friday 8/19/11 and received it next day.  I guess Amazon has not updated the description of the laptop yet.  I have no complaints about the software version as I wanted OS Lion anyway.  However, I do think that Amazon should correct this since there may be some customers that are specifically looking for the older OS.  Otherwise, it's a great laptop as everyone else has described in great detail, so no need for me to repeat them.  I had purchased the latest MBA 11" when it first came out a few weeks ago, but I ended up returning it.  I had no problems with MBA 11" either, but I did find that the font size were too small for my old eyes!  MBA 13" and MBP 13" seemed to be ackward size for me since they are not as portable as MBA 11", and too small to be a everyday computer.  MBA 17" was too big for a laptop and extremely expensive.  So, I setteld on MBP 15" which seems to have the right combination of size, performance, and price (relative to other Macs).  I only give it a 4 star because I still think it's very expensive relative to PC laptops.  Therefore, for people that are on a tighter budget, it may not be suitable.  But, if you can afford it, I highly recommend any of the Macs.	4.0	3.814621686935425
I bought it and it worked only for the first 5 minutes  I bought my Apple MacBook through amazon. It worked for the first five mintutes - then it had to shut down and never came back to life.

Great Value But Few Minor Imperfections  Overall the Sony FE880EH is a great value for the futures being offered. There are a few minor imperfections about this laptop, but I highly recommend. The features that you get with this laptop is of good value.  PROS:  1. The monitor is excellent and even bright enough when I am in the office or outside. By far, Sony's screens are the best.  2. Hard drive and RAM are large enoughto run several programs and to run Windows Vista.  3. The design and look is simple and elegant.  4. Price is great especially with the value you're getting.  NEUTRAL:  1. Sound is not the best, but it works fine.  CONS:  1. There are no bootable CD's and detailed manuals that came with the notebook. All can be found on the internet.  2. Windows Vista tends to slow down when you click the Start Button > All Programs. There is a delay when you scroll through all of the applications. I would notice that the hard drive would be intensively working minutes after the computer was booted up.  3. Windows Media Player has about 3-4 second delay before playing any .mp3 music with this notebook.  4. The battery's life is very short. It lasts about 1.5 - 2 hours under normal usage.  5. The power supply is short.  6. The positioning of the USB should be on the back not all on the sides.	3.0	3.85495924949646

Mouse Did Not Move.  The ad sounded great, but even with downloaded instructions, we could not get the cursor to move and there was no information on keystroke commands.  Also, its web connections were not compatible with what we had.  Too bad the original instruction manual was not included, it would have made a huge difference.	2.0	1.9414234161376953
Really wanted to like this product!  I am sorry I have to give the Asus EEE PC two stars.  I was equally sorry that I had to return it!  In some ways, it is not the computer's fault.  It is small, and I wanted something I could easily take on trips.  It was also reliable, and inexpensive.  But in the end, it didn't work out.  The keys are so small and cramped that I found myself avoiding answering emails and composing a document was out of the question. Further, the screen is so small,that I found I was constantly tweaking webpages so I could read the content.  Asus, if you could make a laptop that was equally light, inexpensive, and reliable as the pc eee--and make the keyboard and the screen bigger, I would be an enthusiastic customer!	2.0	1.9244626760482788
Not for me  Dont get me wrong, this is a great computer and works fine. It just isn't the right computer for me. This computer is just for casual web surfing and file transfer type things, not games or (big) downloads or anything like that. If thats all you do, the I recommend this computer for you. If you have any type of problem, customer service WILL help you, they are great and helped me the same day, within one hour.	3.0	3.023200273513794
Great I love it!!  Its everything I expected plus some! I always wanted to make the switch to mac from pc, but never had the funds. This year I will be attending college so it was mandatory to buy a laptop. I did some research and it was final I was getting a Macbook Pro. I thought about buying the higher end model (2.2, 6750m) , but I will not be doing any heavy gaming so the base model was fine with me. So far is awesome. The glare isn't nearly as bad as people say, and the screen is the beautiful! The 500GB 5400rpm HDD is very snappy and I don't think I will be upgrading to a 7200rpm or SSD anytime soon. I think 4GB of ram is more than enough for anyone, but I may upgrade to 8GB of ram in the future. Battery life is beyond what they claim if you turn down the obvious battery drainers. (Backlight keyboard, Brightness, etc) The trackpad is ALOT better than what i thought! I may just have to buy the wireless trackpad soon. Other than those things this laptop is FAST and durable, and will be even better when Mac OS X Lion comes out in a few days.  So far this what I've bought for this laptop and recommend. -Rain Mstand -Logitech Anywhere mouse -Mini Display to HDMI for dual screening with TVs -Apple Wireless Keyboard -USB Hub (Sadly it only has 2 USB ports) -Moshi Clearguard Keyboard Protector (Strongly recommended if you want to keep it looking new)	5.0	5.150556564331055

Description Needs More Info  My fiancee and myself bought one of these for basic net use and on a limited budget this seemed to be a good choice. Delivery was faster than the expected shipping time. Everything was going fine with our computers until one got a virus. I was using the Microsoft Security anti-virus at first because I figured it would be better than most I have read about. The virus went deep enough into one of the laptops to alter an important setting. I immediately called Link-Tronics tech support. I request a restore disk to see if I can save the laptop. After spending 10 dollars on a cd, i look on the bottom of the laptop to start writing down my authentication code and that is when I notice something. Nothing in the description states that before XP Pro was installed, the laptop had Vista. So with no authentication code for XP Pro, and tech support being absolutely no help at all...I have a very expensive paperweight.	2.0	2.9912755489349365
ASUS EEE  I returned the ASUS EEE and purchased an Acer Aspire One. The ASUS feels as if it was made for a child and appears cheap. The performance was sluggish on the internet. I'm much happier with the Acer Aspire One - it has more bang for the buck.	2.0	1.9982949495315552
Sufficient  I'm posting this from my laptop now. It does everything I need it to do but it can be annoyingly slow at times, especially on the Internet. Netflix is probably the most difficult site to use, though sometimes the whole computer freezes for no apparent reason. But if you don't need a fast computer and your standards of manageable quality and your wallet are both low, I recommend this. I paid less than $100 including shipping and I have access to everything I want. Except the Flixster app. But who cares, it doesn't do what I hoped anyways, according to the online information.	3.0	3.806678533554077
A handy mobile notebook for the money  For the last year or two I've been using two computers for mobile web access and note taking. One is an aging iBook that's starting to develop keyboard and battery problems, and is heavier than I'd like to carry in a backpack or camera bag. The other is my Nokia 770, which is cute, but slow and very limited when it comes to typing or writing notes. I thought about buying a Nokia 810, but the reviews I've read suggested the Eee would be better for my uses. I decided to risk a purchase.  So far, I'm pleased. The Eee boots fast, it's quiet, the screen is more than adequate, and it's very light and compact. True, the keyboard isn't great, but I found it reasonably easy to adjust to. Installing other apps isn't easy, and the 800MHz processor doesn't support graphic editing, but that's not what this machine is intended for; if you want to run the Gimp, get a faster machine. The same goes for running Windows. I thought about installing XP, but that's really stretching the capabilities of this machine, and trying to make it into something it's not.  The Eee is at its best providing a light, inexpensive and very portable platform for basic web activities and simple office tasks. The screen is bigger than any of the pocket-sized computers, the keyboard is better than anything you'll find on a web-enabled phone or Nokia WiFi terminal, and it's a fraction of the price of the more powerful hand helds. As a student computer it's the perfect combination of portability, function, and low cost. If you keep its limitations in mind, and use it for what it's intended for, I think you'll be very happy with it.	4.0	4.054140567779541
Just what it is supposed to do - except for WifFi  My 2G Surf worked perfectly for two months and connected with three different wireless routers during that period.  I was delighted, because wireless connectivity and size were the features that attracted me to the Eee. Then, suddenly, although it still recognized my router's signal, it could not connect to it. Several hours of research on the internet came up with no fix, but did convince me that this is by no means an unusual problem with the Eee.  I was never again able to make a wireless connection.  Then system hangups began to occur more and more frequently until the computer finally locked completely.  At that point I tried to reinstall the system, but the machine hung during the reinstall and was thereafter totally inert. An (extended) phone call to Asus support resulted in a return authorization .  Four days later a NEW computer arrived.  I was delighted with the support.  After finishing the initial start-up sequence I tried to make a connection to my router.  No connection to the router could be made - nothing but a "pending" status.  I have not yet heard from the support group about the wireless issue of this machine. There are claims on the internet that both Ubuntu and Breezy (Puppy Linux) have both successfully addressed the Eee wireless problem. The Eee 2G is everything I expected EXCEPT for WiFi. Unfortunately, it was the most important feature of the computer for me. If WiFi is important to you, I suggest that you hold off on your purchase until Asus cleans up the problem.

Great Product for the Price  This was a great laptop for the price. Super fast shipping!  It was shipped the same day I bought it!  I was a bit disappointed because there was not a restore CD like was listed in the title but other than that I would recommend this seller!	4.0	4.043564796447754
Don't buy Dell  I bought this laptop in 2009 and it has given me trouble from the very beginning. From the very first day, I couldn't even install it and got the 'blue screen of death' when I first turned it on and had to go back to Best Buy for them to try to fix it (which they didn't, so I had to fix it myself...Which reminds me, don't buy from Best Buy either, they're ridiculous and their rewards system is a joke; buy online or some other electronics store). So, it took me about a week after buying it just to start using it.  Then the shortcut/control keys at the top of keyboard are a nuisance. They're touch sensitive, which seemed cool at first, and would have worked if Dell spent more time in developing them. Instead they are usually unusable, since they stay lit up when a first turn it on and won't respond when they are like this. It takes anywhere from 10mins to 2 hours for them to function normally. Not only are those buttons malfunctioning, but the Wifi is poor as well. The on/off switch that controls the wifi, although usually works in that manner, almost always has a problem with the on-screen display/notification that you are turning on/off the Wifi. If you turn it on, an onscreen display makes it look like you're turning it off, while the Wifi indicator light on both your keyboard and router say otherwise. The Wifi also seemed to have a hard time connecting to public networks. It also does not come with a built-in Bluetooth, even though there's a display light (that won't ever be used) on the top of the keyboard. The in-store example did have Bluetooth, though, but apparently the ones they actually sell don't. The disc drive also malfunctions quite often, ejecting your discs randomly.  The only thing I enjoyed about this laptop was the touchpad mousepad. It's based on Alps patents and made selecting, scrolling, and zooming really smooth and cool. My friends who had Macs compared it to their own laptops, although this one was not sensitive to gestures. Instead the right side is dedicated to scrolling up and down, and can continue by moving your finger clockwise, or go backwards counter-clockwise; and the left side is used for zooming in and out. This mousepad is still pretty topnotch, even when compared to newer models coming out.  But it is also not built well, considering the bottom case started to crack after a couple months of use. Laptops -- although should be treated with care -- are meant to be mobile; and most need to be dropped or mishandled in order to crack and break. I treated mine very carefully, but the bottom still cracked, and continues to break apart. That also goes for the fan. The laptop is prone to overheating (like most Dell models) and the fan is poorly made, considering it broke in about 3-6 months of use, which only magnified the overheating problems.  Do not buy Dell laptops: unreliable, poorly made, easily breakable, often lacking features, but still expensive and costly. They might be good for desktops. But if you want a good laptop (whether for basic word processing, advanced programs for mathematics or design, to gaming) buy HP, Lenovo, Apple (although Macs are generally not used for gaming, but good for design software), or maybe even a Toshiba.	2.0	1.9293469190597534
Cool Beans!  Mac Book Pro Review  Okay, so as I write this review, I am using my awesomely cool new Apple MacBook Pro.  I've only had it for 3 days though, so I'm not sure if I've been getting the best performance out of it yet. But so far its been great, with only a couple of kinks.  In this review I'll go over the main things that most of you all would like to know about. It won't all be overly detailed, because then it will be too drawn out and long, and I don't like to drawn out and long reviews.  Okay first up, the over all look, and feel:  If you've experienced Apple products in the past, you know what I'm talk'n bout when I say that this piece of hardware is THE ABSOLUTE BEST! Its so cool, I mean when you whip this thang out at school, work, or in the airport (I travel bunches). You won't believe how many people stop by and are like "Is that an Apple? I didn't know they were THAT cool. I'm gonna go and have to get me one of those!" After I've heard that a number of times I know that I've done my job for Apple as a spokesperson (seriously, I should like take over the Apple company or something). The MacBook Pro has a 15.4 display and it is bright, and I mean super bright. It's so crisp and clear you'll  think your on your imac or something.  The MacBook Pro is definitely thin. When its closed its super small. It's just a little bit heavier than I thought it would be but thats just because I moved to this from and iBook G4.  And in saying that I come to think of its speed:  Whoa is this thing fast! Compared to my iBook it definitely is. I have only been running Universal Applications though, so I can't say that things might not slow down a bit in Rosetta. I know that I will be adding more RAM in about 5 months or so, because my job includes making lots of videos, using iTunes, burning bunches of CD's and DVD's.  Let's see, hmmm, ahh yes, the little magsafe power connecter. It's pretty cool, nothing to write home about though. It did do it's job when I almost smashed my MacBook Pro onto the horrible floor of death. I was pretty relieved when I realized that I had Magsafe by my side.  Battery Life:  The first day I used my MacBook Pro without the power cord attached I only got about 2:30, now that is not very long at all. BUT, I did what the manual said and calibrated my battery, now  battery life lasts about 3 and a half hours, now thats much much better if you ask me!  Oh! I almost forgot! The most important thing, I can't even tell that there are INTEL PROCESSORS in the MacBook. It still looks, feels and runs completely like a Mac.  Now here comes the bad part of the review, yes the cons. No I don't like them either, but no laptop is absolutely PERFECT, not even in Apple:  1. When I insert a CD or DVD into my optical drive man does it make this horrible noise, now I know my ibook made a noise, but it wasn't near as bad as this. I'm gonna get this checked out soon though.  2. As I am writing this, my MacBook Pro is like hot, not warm, but hot! Now I know this is normal because it is so thin, but I don't want thighs with my MacBook Pro imprint on them this summer, but as a girl on the go, and a hard core traveler, I know I have to accept this.  3. Sometimes, for about a minute every once and a while there is this hissing noise, but its very faint and you will only notice it if your in a very quiet room with only the crickets going at it.  4. Since the MacBook Pro is a lot thinner than my previous iBook, they had to downsize the so it dosen't burn CD's any faster than my iBook.  All of these things are minor and are sure to be fixed with a firmware update. Until then, I can manage.  My last and final words are just that this is such a wonderful laptop. I am so happy that I recieved one of  these. It has been so much fun so far.  A few things that I recommend purchasing with your MacBook Pro are:  1. A nice sleeve for your MacBook Pro so that you can through it in your bag without worrying about getting it all scratched up : booqbags.com  the Vyper M2 Sleeve is a good one.  2. A keyboard cover (you have to protect your investment!) iskin.com  3. Apple Care because you never know what could happen to it! apple.com  4. A .Mac account so that you can do all sorts of stuff with iWeb (believe me it's so cool) apple.com  And thats pretty much all that I can think of!  Hope this review helped, go out and get one!	5.0	5.144298553466797
VAIO PCG-FRV25  This is my first PC experience.  I am Apple man, so I have come to expect  extremely reliable and well built machines.  This laptop seems to meet my expectations so far.  Solid feel and performance. The only dislike I have is the battery life. It does not quite reach 2 hours of use. For the price and feature ratio you can't go wrong with this laptop.	5.0	4.051785945892334

DO NOT BUY FROM CAJUNMAN He is an irresponsible and disreputable seller..  The product I received was very very poor. I am not talking about cosmetically, because age and use happens in 7 years of course. But to have the charger spark and short out immediately, and the screen not even stay up, and the optical drive won't even take a disk let alone function with one. His response to me was that I had too high expectations for a 7 year old computer. But at the price and description as Used acceptable one would expect it would work some how?!?!	1.0	0.9048033952713013

Toshiba Satellite A215-S7462 Laptop  Purchased 11/3/07 Like most of the other reviews that I have seen while trying to find solutions to problems with my Toshiba Satellite A215-S7462 Laptop, the screen would just simply black out and nothing that I could do would bring the screen back up.  The Toshiba Service Center told me that the only way to get the unit to come back up is to crash it by turning off the AC power and then take the battery out, which means loosing anything that you were working on back to your last save.  Toshiba knows of this problem and it has existed on other series of their laptops.  The problem is that their power saving features do not work.  The Service Rep said the only way to stop this from happing is to: Access the Control Panel Select Power Options Choose the last power option feature which maximises power to the computer at all times and cuts off power saving features. For "On Battery" and "Plugged In", set "Tun off the display" and "Put the computer to sleep" to "Never".  This works, but the unit runs on max power all of the time, which causes the battery to completely run down is less than an hour even with minimal use.  If you are needing a laptop with long battery life, this is not the unit that you want to buy.  This is really poor performance, especially for a lithium battery.  Toshiba's docking stations will not work with Vista.  The Toshiba service rep said that Toshiba is aware of the problem, but is not working on a fix.  So if you are going to use this at home, be prepared to have a laptop that looks like an octopus with several cables plugged into each side since none of the USB or other ports are in the back of the unit.  The only manual that comes with the unit is electronic and is made for 2 different series of laptops.  The guide does not differentiate which features are on which series.  The explanations of the features and utilities are useless.  You are told that they exist and how to access them, but are not told how to use them.  Some features are not even talked about like how to access the WiFi feature.  Kind of like buying a rocket ship and being told to enter a close the door, with no instructions on what all those gadgets inside are for or how to use them.  There a numerous junk software programs that come preloaded that you have to pay additionally for after a 30 day trial period.  This consumes a lot of time trying to figure out what you can get rid of safely.  All of the new machines are coming with Vista.  Be prepared for a big learning curve.  Vista and Microsoft Office Pro 2007 are user hostile because all of the basic tools have been so radically changed and relocated that it is just like having to learn a completely new way of doing things. If you have not had the privilage to experience Vista yet, go to a computer store, click on the Start icon and try to figure how to shut the pc down.	3.0	2.9947009086608887
Just give me what I ask for before you give me what you think I need!?!  Great computer, but the reason I ordered it was it came with WIndows XP which I needed for a particular software I use. They upgraded it to windows 7 without asking me, now the unit is useless for what I need. They meant well, but it wasted my money.	4.0	1.9646958112716675

My first Mac became my best laptop!  This is my first Mac in my 15 years of IT life. My requirements were 12" or 13" screen, lightweight, good battery life, and should look beautiful. I am a Software Engineer and do a lot of photography, and sometimes make videos too. So I needed a laptop which has high performance, good battery life, and a beautiful design.  I was considering Macbook Air, Macbook Pro, and new VAIO Z for a month, and decided to get this Macbook Pro 2011. The price on Amazon was pretty good. This Amazon price (discounted & no tax) was actually better than the student price after tax. I decided to get an Macbook Pro with core i7 2.7Ghz since I cannot use nice CPU for Air (it is limited), and I had been using 3 VAIO models (SR, SZ, Z) laptop for last 3 years so wanted to try Mac. I am very pleased with my purchase.  I love the user interface most, the speed, and battery life although it took me little time to get used to my first mac. The new core i7 is really fast, and I upgraded the ram from 4gb to 8gb to use Parallels faster. Backlit keyboard is so beautiful, and multi-touch trackpad is super convenient. Two fingers with all-way scrolls, and three fingers with browsing back and forward.  I would say this Macbook Pro (lighter than 2010 version) is the best laptop for me so far over my former experience with VAIO, HP, Compaq, Acer, Samsung, Netbooks, and etc. Someone complained about heating problems, but I don't feel like that. This amount of heat is much better than HP, Compaq, and better than VAIO.  If you don't need super fast laptop, I recommend you a basic model of Macbook Pro. Your main usage is web surfing and documenting, I recommend you to get a Macbook Air. If you never used Mac, I strongly recommend you to experience it. BTW, when you buy a Mac, get a basic model if it is possible and upgrade it. It will save you a lot of money. I upgraded RAM by myself, and will upgrade HDD to SSD soon. I can't wait to use SATA III SSD on my MBP!	5.0	5.1472320556640625
Don't buy it!!! The black screen got me too!!!  2 weeks ago our laptop died and because I swore I'd never buy another Compaq again, we went with the Toshiba on the recommendation of our computer tech. BAD IDEA!! The first day we got it I was on the internet and the screen went black. I figured I must have hit something that set it in hibernation mode so I held down the power button until it shut down and restarted it again. A couple hours later, same thing...the next day, again and so on. I decided to do some research as I was planning on taking it in tomorrow to have it looked at. Well, after going on many websites, I have discovered this is happening all over the place.  I am not the only one!!! I wish I had read these reviews before I bought mine. Needless to say, I am taking this laptop back tomorrow. I am not wasting my time with a company that KNOWS they are selling a product that is flawed and yet they continue to do so. Don't buy this computer, you will be sorry!!	1.0	0.9041622877120972
Honestly, why go with anything else?  Unless you're planning on seriously breaking into your computer and customizing it to alienware levels, this is the only laptop worth getting. The Mac OS is superior in every aspect from UI (user interface) to organization to performance. Simply put, it's the easiest OS to use and everything "just works" There's hardly a chance of getting any viruses (if you do virus-conducive activities though, ProtectMac AntiVirus is the best). The hardware is excellent too, down to the tiniest details. The backlit keyboard, the glossy display, the light aluminum, it's aesthetics and functionality are perfect. The price is a bit steep, but this will honestly pay for itself in ease of use and longevity. Definitely worth getting over any other laptop out there!	5.0	5.150496006011963
Linux users beware  I've had this laptop for around 18 months, and it is sufficient for what I use it for.  If you're looking for a primary system though, I'd look someplace else.  If you do purchase one, the first thing you should do is stick another GB of RAM in it.  The 1GB that it comes with really doesn't cut it, especially if you're going to run Vista on it.  I currently have Ubuntu 8.04 installed, and ran into 2 issues that anyone who intends to run a Linux laptop should be aware of.  First, the wifi card is an internal USB RTL8187b.  Yes, that's right -- internal USB.  This is unsupported in linux by Realtek, and the 8187 driver DOES NOT work with this card.  This also means that you can't just replace the wifi card with a supported chipset to fix the problem.  It's a proprietary design and is apparently specific to this laptop.  The only way to get the wireless to work is to use a Windows driver wrapper (didn't work on my distro), or compile your own patched driver.  Not a novice problem to solve.  Also, the wifi switch on the case is apparently software driven and doesn't function in linux (it's always on).  Second, the power management is flaky.  I didn't have Vista on it long enough verify whether it's an issue there as well, but the laptop consumes power even when off.  Not just in sleep mode, even when completely powered down.  Let the machine sit for a couple days and the battery is dead without fail.  I know there was a BIOS issue with the A105 that did this, but the A205s appear to be notorious for bricking during a BIOS flash.  I'm not going to try it.  All in all, you get what you pay for.  Toshiba apparently cut a bunch of corners to hit their price point on this one, so this is likely the last Toshiba I'll buy.	2.0	1.9602066278457642
Great notebook,  wrong size free case  Loving this notebook PC after receiving it 3 days ago. Only change I would have made by custom ordering it would be a RAM upgrade, but that's easy to do aftermarket. (...)Amazon has the best price I found. Hooray for Lance!! and supporting the LAF!  The promo free Targus 17" Citygear L.A. bag is very nice, but way oversize for this notebook.  A much better choice would be the Targus citygear NY 15" model with still some room to spare. But hey, free is free.  Still, would be better if it was the right size case in the offer.  Check the dimensions.	4.0	3.9814465045928955

Toshiba support stinks  Just bought the P15-S409.  So far so good.  Until I called support in Istanbul Turkey.  Polite but only capable of telling me official Toshiba policies and not caring about actually solving the problem.  To quote them: "Toshiba does not support upgrades from XP Home to Pro".  Well gee, I guess I'll throw this computer away and buy a new one.  Nothing like having a product represented by a third party that doesn't give a.	2.0	2.085059881210327
A Good Computer For Teenagers  I use a Dell (my work computer) but when I wanted to buy a laptop for my two teenage daughters I picked this one.  It seems to have enough features for them to enjoy now, and it probably should last them 2-3 years (seems to be the life expectancy of a laptop, at least for me).  They play a lot of video games on it and the processor is fast enough to keep up with the graphics.  My sons all own Apples and usually swear by them, but sometimes (when they play video games) they swear at them.  So far I think that I make the right choice with this computer.	4.0	3.409032106399536
Bad Keyboard and bad screen  The keyboard on the Macbook pro MA895LL/A is terrible. It lacks proper response.

Great notebook with minor issues!  This notebook is great for someone that travels.  After comparing many notebooks in it's class. Going to stores annd physcially playing with them I found this notebook to be most portable and have some of the more powerful features.  This is the lightest I found in the 14.1 in screen size notebook.  This notebook looks great and is powerful enough to satisfy most users.  I guess I can list all the problems that way buyers can pay attention to those things when purchasing this notebook.  The most noticeable draw back was the battery life.  It comes with a 3 cell battery which amounts to about a 2 hours max battery life.  I suggest buying the 6 cell battery which will double you battery life.  I did have some issues with the 802.11b card which signal faded alot.  I had them put in the 802.11g instead and it works great. The next problem I found was the notebook gets really hot after a while (1/2 hour).  But not to where it might burn you just a bit unconfortable.  Finally I the cd-rom drive to be a bit loud.  Aside from these minor issues which can be easyly fixed, I found this notebook to be a great buy.  After rebates and discounts I think this was the best bang for my buck.	4.0	4.413465976715088

This Apple is rotten  I have been a long long time Apple supporter and have always recommended Apple over PC to everyone who asks my opinion - including my daughter.  However, recently I have not been so fast to do so.  A little over a year ago I convenience my daughter to spend her hard earned money on a MacBook.  What a mistake. She is on her third one, which has now this morning frozen up and according to the people at Apple on the phone sounds like the hard drive is gone.  If so, they want $900 to replace.  Now when people ask me about Apple all I can say is - My daughter has had 3 models in a little over a year and all three have had hard drive problems and on top of that Apple's support has been pretty much worthless - so you do the math.  I was waiting to order a new powerbook for my self when they finally introduce Leopard but I have to admit this once good Apple seems to be rotting.	1.0	0.9097636938095093

A great laptop  I'm not a heavy user by any means, I basically use the laptop for surfing the web and emails. But this machine just doesn't even have the horse power to do that.

The size and battery is excellent though, but all in all will not buy another Acer laptop ever again.	2.0	3.1052865982055664
Don't buy it.  I have had the Vaio for more than a month and am still not able to fully use it. It comes loaded with promotionals that are difficult to remove. I have wasted many hours of time. It is really annoying nd not worth its cost. I have had always had Dells before this and I will go back to them. The fingerprint logon does not work. I am new to Vista and this has been frustrating too. It does not do several things that Windows XP did. One good thing was that Sony help line was helpful.	2.0	1.980115532875061
Lemon - buyer beware  Bought two laptops from Apple last year and first one for my daughter - this MacBook - was lemon from beginning.

Not all that great  -------------------- I don't think it is such a GREAT notebook as some people are talking about it. The 3 things I don't like about it are: 1. It comes with Windows XP Home. What you will do with all this super configuration without certain features like Backup and Automated Recovery, IIS, Remote Desktop connection etc. which doesn't come with XP Home edition. The worst part is Toshiba doesn't support the upgrade (I called up Toshiba to confirm this after looking at the review by Thomas Fitzgibbon below). You have to spend another $300 to get XP pro which puts the cost of this notebook equals to or even greater than some good note books available in the market. 2. The DVD writer comes with it can only write on to DVD -R disks. While the whole industry is turning to +R type, it would be better if you have a writer that writes on to both +/- types. And none the less the speed of the writer is disappointing (1x and 2x). 3. Hard drive size and battery life are also disappointing. I am not saying tha it is a bad one but definitely there is a room for improvement in this model for the price we are paying and thus it is not all that great and super duper notebook that you can have.	3.0	2.2116708755493164

Is there anything else to say?  This is one of the best laptops on the market.  The old canard that it's more expensive than equivalent Windows laptops just isn't true.  You have to dig into the specs of this thing to really make a comparison.  But that's irrelevant, let's talk about the laptop itself.  The good  * Very nice graphics.  When plugged in you get nice HD video from an AMD 6490M (when you're plugged in) or from an Intel 3000HD when on battery. * Multi touch (well almost) trackpad.  It's missing a couple of things from the huge Magic Trackpad from Apple, but it has everything I can use.  I can really maneuver around the computer with my trackpad. * Brilliant screen, 1440X900, absolutely HD. * OSX 10.7 Lion.  Really the best OSX by far, and amazing what it can do. * Speedy quad-core i7 processor.  My massive Excel spreadsheets recalc fast.  And working with Photoshop and Aperture show no issues whatsoever.  This laptop really can be considered a mobile desktop. * Beautiful aluminum case.  Just makes it feel expensive.  (One note, aluminum does bend easily, so if you're rough with your computer, get one of those protective skins.) * Nice built-in camera for video chatting, Skype or other things. * Easy to upgrade to 8GB memory.  And you can get it for a lot less than Apple charges.  Not so good  * I'm not a big fan of the speakers.  They don't put out very much sound, even at full blast.  It's kind of hard to watch movies without a headset. * The hard drive is light for the price.  Amazon sells 1TB 2.5" hard drives for a good price, but upgrading the hard drive takes some skill to do it right.  Overall, I am very happy with the laptop.  I use it for everything from basic web browsing to photo editing to business work.  I have had a lot of MacBooks, so I guess I'm not only used to them, I know how to get the most of them.  This one is a great one.	5.0	4.528853416442871
20% more expensive, marginal performance gains  I am an apple fan and enjoy using the macbook but I just cannot recommend this laptop at the moment to others based on what you are getting for your money.  If you are looking for the best bang for your buck, then you should unfortunately look elsewhere.  In the midst of economic trouble apple has decided to increase the cost of their new entry level aluminum macbooks by 20% over early 2008s models with marginal performance gains from the additional front side bus.  Pros -new trackpad has cool factor (although buggy) -new graphic card has made this a decent gaming platform -design is smooth and polished  Cons - Overall performance based on price has decreased.  Now instead of getting a 2.4Ghz dual core for $1300 you must shell out an additional $300 @ $1600 to acquire this performance. If you checkout macworld's benchmarks the performance gained over the additional FSB is marginal at best.  The only gains come in frames per second during game testing. - graphics card is nice but most ppl are not even into hardcore computer gaming and the macbook use to be a nice alternative to the pro models hefty price tag for us non gamers....wish this could have been an option. -160GB or 250GB hard drive with only 5400rps!  At these price points I expected at the minimum 7200rps.  I know this can be manually changed, but who wants to shell even more money after buy such an expensive laptop.  Overall this computer performs well but the price is even becoming to high for some of us apple fans.  The macbooks have always been a top of the line luxury laptop but now they are widening that gap even further with design not performance fueling the price increases.  My recommendation is to wait at this time b/c come mid 2009 the prices will hopefully fall and Apple's new and improved SnowLeopard OS will be out.  With Steve Jobs you never buy the first iteration of a new product, unless you are willing to pay top dollar for something that will decrease in price by 20% in 6months.	2.0	2.9748475551605225

need a recall - wireless stops working  I've had a tx for about two years and, a few days ago, its wireless adapter stopped working (first it became intermittent and then it stopped for good). I tried everything HP recommended: updated the BIOS, reinstalled drivers and - in complete despair - even run a "hard reset", returning the device to its original state. Then I googled a bit and found many other Pavilion owners with exact the same problem. For instance, take a look at this article [...] Things can always get worse and, when I contacted HP, they refused to provide me any assistance because I bought my laptop overseas (in Chile) - although the guy who sold it to me assured me that there would be no such restriction. So now I'm gonna have to take my laptop to an unauthorized repair center.	2.0	0.9122239947319031

Good, but not great  I read all reviews in Amazon for this product, and they all pretty much include all the pros and cons I found with my machine.  I first got a tx2120 to replace my old Acer 5050, since I have to attend several meetings at work, and I return to school--I thought a tablet PC will be a functional and efficient way to go.  I only kept it for 2 days after struggling with most of the programs I require for my job to work on a 64-bit Vista OS. I replaced it with the tx2110, and after working several issues with Vista  compatibilities, I got it to work.  After having it for three months, I think the product is not as good for the purposes it was designed.  I can not use it at job meetings or in the class at school because of the ridiculous loud noise it makes--very disruptive.  If the room is bright, the screen reflects a lot.  And as others mentioned, it gets steamy hot!  I hope I have kept my old Acer, which was as fast as the tx2120 or tx2110 (with only 1GB or ram), and because I paid for futures that are functional but very disruptive.  Since the tablet PC feature works great to its advantage, I give it a 3-star rating (otherwise it would probably a 1-2).  And HP's customer care is not the best, so be ready to make several calls, and maybe mail your machine to get it fixed.	3.0	2.9602110385894775

A word to PC Users  I use a PC at work, and do some of my work remotely from home. When Apple came out with the duo core Intel processor, I still wasn't convinced that I could happily move to a new system. Let me tell you; it is the finest computer I have ever owned! I have this gut feeling that Apple made this dual OS move to convince PC users once and for all; this is the only computer you will ever want.  There is plenty of support out there for learning the new language of Mac, but it is amazingly easy. The first thing you must learn is that Mac is intuitive. I was prepared to go through pages of setup instructions to hook up my internet, but Mac did it all for me, no questions, no permissions, just had to enter my WEP key to enter my service provider environment. WOW!  Switching between systems? Boot, hold down the 'options' key, and choose your system. I you want to use Windows, you will need to purchase a new Windows XP SP2 single disk version; If you want Office tools, likewise, though many use the Mac version of Word and Excel.  What is hard to get used to? No 'delete' key (Mac has a 'delete' key, but it functions as a backspace) When you are in the Windows environment, you have to use mouse 'click' functions to delete things. Also, No 'home' or 'end' keys. All the above functions require 2 key-strokes on the Mac.  This is the only trouble I have found; It pales in comparison to the nightmares of Virus software, updates for security and everything else that seemed to drag my old system down. Get this computer; you will never regret it.	5.0	5.140758991241455

Apple is NO better than Windows  It's alright, it got extremely slow after being used for 4 years and it was altogether 7 yrs old but the previous owner never used it, I got it in the original box and now it's dead. But the computer was like a regular Windows computer as far as reliability, I thought I was buying something more reliable than a Dell or HP. The reality is that it uses the EXACT same processors, hard-drives, RAM, as any other Windows computer. But the software is different. The Windows computers are built to break after 3-4 years of use. The Apple computers are built to break after 4-6 years of use. The difference is that in Apple computers you don't really need virus protection, so the extra money you spent on an apple was for the added fire-wall protection. BOTH APPLE AND WINDOWS plan the obsolescence of their products and deliberately make new software to break down your old computer. MY POINT: Buy which ever computer you want, NEVER upgrade the software, keep it in a case, don't leave it plugged in and don't run the battery all the way down, and always put it down on flat hard clean surfaces.	2.0	2.1208198070526123
It won't even turn on...  I was initially excited once I ordered this laptop.  I knew I was rolling the dice with a referb, but I figured with good reviews it would be worth it.  Sadly once I received it, It didn't come with the software I was promised and the battery was unable to keep much of a charge.  To the sellers credit, they sent me a knew battery and the software promised.  Kudos to you!  And thank goodness, weeks after I took out the old battery it popped open! What the heck! Now here we are within 6 months of purchase and it won't even turn on.  I've have replaced batteries, bought a new charging cord, ran all updates, it the laptop is a big paperweight.  I'm at a loss.  So much for my safe roll of the dice.	1.0	0.9064884185791016

Awesome Computer!  This is the first Mac that I have owned.  I also own an iPhone 4 and an iPad (first generation).  I love this product.  Two days ago, I updated to Lion, free of charge, since I bought this MacBook Pro from Amazon after June 6, 2011.  It is great for surfing the web, work, watching movies, everything!  I am an attorney, and formatting of Word documents is critically important to me.  I installed Mac Office 2011 on my MacBook Pro.  It works fabulously.  No formatting errors with my PC friends at work when working on Word docs on my Mac.  Buy this Mac, you won't go back!	5.0	5.141449451446533
Pretty good  I find this a useful little machine; however, I find it hard to log onto some wireless connections sometimes. I thought it would be a bit easier that it is!	4.0	3.924372673034668
Impressive Specs. Good competitor against the Lenovo X60 and Sony SZ.  PROS:  -Small/compact  -Fast processor - 2.0GHz - Core 2 Duo is brand new  -2GB!! of RAM - impressive  -Gorgeous screen  -Massive 120GB hard drive  -DVD burner  -5-in-1 memory card reader  -Multimedia controls  -Comfortable keyboard  -Bluetooth  -Plenty of ports and connects  CONS:  -Above average weight - 4lbs is pushing the ultracompact weight  -Integrated graphics - for some, a deal breaker, especially with the SZ running a hybrid PCI/integrated carding system  -Battery life - Great, but not compared to its competition. I got roughly 4.5 hours from it, but got almost double that from the Lenovo, and about an hour more from Sony.  -Small trackpad - Really small, to some not a problem - with 3 usb ports, you can find room for a mouse  -No webcam - not a dealbreaker, just a good add-on Sony, and other competitors, have  BOTTOM LINE: GREAT for college students. The price may be a concern for a computer with integrated graphics, but multitasking is a breeze with 2GB or RAM. Not the best in it's class, but surely a great deal. This is one of the better of the Toshiba family. This upgraded Tecra M6 sure show's its potential!	4.0	4.143087863922119

Lasts 3 Years & Dies A Slow Death...Guaranteed  I love my MacBook...or I should say, I did...I got it the DAY it released in November 2009- on accident actually because that is the day I went to Best Buy. I started off with a Toshiba that eventually just stopped working one day when the screen blacked out. Then I got the MacBook. It was hard to get use to at first with the finger track pad, but once I got use to it, there was no going back. Everything seemed easier with my Mac. No need to worry about viruses, fast speed... Then everything started going horribly, horribly wrong. The rubber bottom peeled of halfway. There is no way to fix it because the screws don't hold it. I noticed new versions don't have the rubber. Hmm...Wonder why... First I would get that spinning colored wheel that functions as a waiting hourglass. More and more often now I get the spinning color wheel for 5 minutes before a page loads. Sometimes it goes on for over 20 minutes. Now it just happens randomly while I'm on a page. Then the mouse stopped functioning all the time. It can take me 5 minutes to get the mouse to the top of the screen. Close the laptop. Wait. Open. It works for a minute or two then freezes or disappears. Close. Open. Repeat. OMG! So now I have a laptop that freezes and the mouse stops working. What next? Lately my screen just blacks out for 10 seconds. Finally I caved and went to Best Buy. The guy said "of course it's not working- it's dying and it's OLD!" I've only had it for not quite 3 YEARS! He explained that my operating system (Snow Leopard) was slow and phased out. I could buy one of the newer ones, but it wouldn't help much. I could get more processing-but it wouldn't help much. It was old, dated, and dying. I needed a new one. He said that the intentionally make the technology to fail in a few years so you have to buy a new one. And in the meantime, you have to buy their updates to keep up. I knew this was the case with phones, but not laptops. Sadly, according to him, my laptop will be dead within a year and I needed to buy a hard drive to spend 48+ hours transferring my information before it's gone forever. I should buy a new one ASAP. WHY?? It will just die in 3 years!! Mac - and Apple- turned out to be a much better version of something that's going to die in a few years anyways...	3.0	2.0729997158050537

A215-S7422 ---- Love the sound, hate the crash  Have owned A215-S7422 for almost two years, a frustrating two years I should say. What I love the most about this laptop is the Dolby sound, much much better than my husband's Thinkpad, combined with bright screen display, we use it mainly for playing movies now, and I guess that's what this laptop was designed for anyways. But I just hate the constant crash!!!  Tried the tricks other reviewers offered, no big improvement. Because it happens when it's too hot (it heats so quickly, and the heat can literally burn your lap if you are wearing shorts!) and when you open/run too many (like five or six) windows/files at same time. Battery life is so short (40 mins or so), and there is almost no warning when battery is about to run out, it just go dead like that.  You just lose your work without any warning when those happen, I find myself so inefficient working with this laptop. Perhaps I should just avoid multi-tasking and just watch movies with this laptop, and constantly save my work, always sit near a power outlet or check the battery every 5 mins, and run a fan or put a cooling pad on my lap to cool it/myself down, no big deal, right?  If you are not really into movies, then I suggest you stay away from this laptop for the sake of your sanity.	3.0	3.0114994049072266
Blue Screen of Death: Hoping Our Hair Grows Back  We've had Three Toshiba A215-S7422s #1 - Missing pixels on screen - exchanged for #2 #2 - Wireless card didn't work - exchanged for #3 #3 - Blue Screen of Death - see Ricardo, Michael Ditowsky and Rajeesh below  Supplement to their very good info  1) DO NOT CALL TOSHIBA - This only added to our aggravation - the phone attendent, no doubt on the other side of the planet, seemed as if he were reading que cards to respond to our questions, and denied any knowledge of such a problem as the BSOD.  2) Best path to Advanced power options in Vista is: Start, Control Panel, CLASSIC view, Power Options, Turn Off Display (to access next link (proc pwr mgmt)), processor power mgmt, change minimum processor to 100% (though we're also going to test 50%).  Also may want to change battery/plugged- in options to "never"  3) Cross your fingers, knock on wood, throw salt over your left shoulder, and kiss your wife.  Good Luck.	3.0	1.973387360572815
The Perfect Computer  I had been looking for a new laptop for probably a year; holding out for something that would be portable, powerful and stylish.  My wait was over when the SZ came out.  This notebook is amazingly fast - it is snappier than the dual core 2GB of RAM desktop I have at work!  The case is beautiful with brushed aluminum palmrests and very good build quality.  The battery life is less than the "7 hours" in the description but I easily get 3-4 hours a charge.  The bottom line is you will not find a laptop this small with dedicated graphics and this much power at any price!  Speaking of price, the only con I found (and this is amazon's fault, not sony's) is that a few days after I received it the price came down by a hundred dollars!  This works in your favor as it is an even better deal.	5.0	5.163437843322754
Everything I expected out of my first Mac  I've been a long time Linux user and having a Mac is awesome because you have all the power of a Linux machine under a fantastic UI. Everything is well thought of, things behave like you expect, it's sleek and fast. I love it.	5.0	5.150276184082031
keyboard shines , lcd idem  Although pretty, when I used it the reflexion of light hurted my eyes.  It's just frustrating to have a brand new notebook thats is ugly to use.  If Toshiba has a differente case (that not shines), with a different keyboard and even a different LCD  please contact me.  But now I do not use it anymore - I'm looking another notebook.	2.0	1.96916663646698

My Experience  I got my Vaio S460 10 days ago, I've been playing around with it a lot and am very satisfied with it. About the heat issue, I kind of expected it to be hot after reading some reviews in this site, but to my surprise I found out that it is not that hot. Ok, it gets warm, but not being able to place it on your lap is an exaggeration. I have spent many hours with this laptop on my lap without any discomfort. I've read that most heat is produced by the video card GPU, and there is an option available for reducing heat production and fan noise by decreasing the GPU speed, but I bought this laptop because of the dedicated video card so I don't see myself using that option.  About the fan issue, it is not even an issue; it is not at all noisy. It gets on and off repeatedly but is not by any means annoying. The DVD drive does get noisy when reading some data DVDs but then again, it is not annoying.  The keyboard is just perfect sized, you won't have any trouble using it, the computer is really fast and the screen is awesome, very bright, I usually use it in brightness 6 when on AC power and in 3 when on battery to extend battery life. The laptop size is very convenient; I just get it in my backpack and I'm gone. It weights less than the books I used to carry around and it looks really sleek and fancy. I'm getting around 3 hours 30 min of battery life, maybe not the best around, but it is ok for my needs. The only thing that bothered me was to create my own recovery kit, sony should include recovery discs with the laptop.  So, it is a very fast, sleek and eye catching little machine, and I would definitely buy it again if I had to buy another laptop.	5.0	4.017309665679932
Good buy! :)  Works very well all besides having to be hooked up to the charger to operate. I believe it needs a new battery but for me this is just fine because I just use it around the house anyway, so Im very satisfied with this purchase.	4.0	4.013843536376953
Shame on you Apple!  Well, all I can say is that my experience with Apple and their Macbook Pro (MBP) has been a total disaster! I ordered my MBP on May 30th, and since then I've had three(!) replacements due to terrible build quality. The first MBP went back because the case was buckled above the battery, the lid didn't close properly, and it kicked out huge amounts of heat. The second MBP went back because the screen catch was broken on delivery. My third, and final MBP is about to go back because the LCD has extremely uneven illumination and the lid doesn't close properly (one side closes flush to the keyboard, whilst the opposite side has a gap of almost 0.5cm). My advice to anyone considering a MBP is to wait until they have ironed out their quality control issues. I was a Mac convert, but I might just convert back :-(	1.0	0.9112652540206909
I really like my laptop!!  This laptop is very user friendly, and has a lot of unique capabilities. The screen is thin, and wide for a fantastic crisp looking screen display; however, the price is the biggest downfall of this product. In fact I got my laptop for free!! Just paste this site in your address bar, and have fun with it!  [...]	5.0	4.980949401855469

Good laptop for the price  I brought the laptop about 1 month ago. It plays DVDs well. I thought it might not considering the small video memory. As many people have pointed out it gets heated up fast. But considering that the price is less than any other laptop giving these features I am more than happy.	4.0	4.042987823486328
Kudos to Apple !!  This was an amazing product from Apple.  I'm very much satisfied with its sleek and stylish look, feather weight, glossy display.... list goes on 'n on..  I would say onething very clear - Don't ever miss a chance to buy this one !  Good Luck !!	5.0	5.1425371170043945
laptop survey as requisted  The machine only worked for 2 weeks and then the arrow went out of control and I could not stop it anywhere.  We took it to a TECH and he worked on it or over an hour and then gave up .  He said the unit was too old and would not pay to try to get it fixed.  So we realized these things do not come with a guarantee so another lesson learned. Mrs. Wendell (Jean)  Larson	1.0	0.9091759920120239
Very Happy  This is a great notebook for all my applications. I even got great customer support when I messed up some settings. I got this to be able to more seemlessly have my work files available for those inspirational moments.  It worked great out of the box and is actually better than my work PC.  Not bad for most games either. Beautiful screen.  Get one now for an upgrade! Two points have been brought up that should be addressed. 1.  There is a workaround to upgrade to XP Pro on the Microsoft web site. I've not done this yet but it is nice to know it can be done.  It involves shutting off a couple of apps, loading the system, and turning them back on.  The Toshiba script kitties are not qualified to tell you the details.  Do a google search! 2. For it's price this laptop stands up well.  The next computer in this line I would buy costs at least $2K, and I shopped hard and long before selecting this model. This is not the top of line laptop for all purposes.  It does what I need (business apps, most games, graphics) for less money than I would have spent elsewhere.  It's that benefit/cost ratio that got my attention.  It just suits my immediate, and foreseeable, needs.	5.0	4.057713985443115
Excellent working order aside from the speakers being half blown  Excellent working order aside from the speakers being half blown. Took off 2 stars because it was advertised as very good condition. I'd say fair or good at best by my standards but I still feel for the price it was a good deal. Maybe my standards are high but still I think when selling used electronics some photos of the actual item should be required. That way you know exactly what you're buying.	3.0	2.2758822441101074
You should know how much I am mad at the Averatec laptop.  This is my first time to review a product! I cannot believe this product has this much high rating! Don't be deceived by the previous compliments to this product. Now I seriously regret that I spent my money on this shoddy laptop. Now I'm searching for a new laptop just one year after I bought this product. This laptop has tons of defects, but especially the AC adapter sucks! It is really hot not in a good way, the battery life is short, the speaker sound is bad, the fan is VERY noisy, and the AC adapter stopped working because it melted the plastic around the connector. If you have enough money to check whether my complains are true, buy it as you please. Otherwise, keep my warnings in mind!	1.0	1.6899919509887695
No charging after 1 week of use  What a piece of crap from laptop4u.  A rebuilt dell latitude D610.  The charging  system stopped working and is now dead.
