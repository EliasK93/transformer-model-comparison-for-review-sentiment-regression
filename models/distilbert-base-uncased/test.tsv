Love the notebook HATE WINDOWS VISTA  I recently purchase a new HP notebook and I honestly thought that this will be better than my no so old Acer turion 64 TK-53  2.0 GHZ at least on hardware my HP looks superior, but much to my surprise the ACER work faster, better, and with more stability than my new "hardware superior" HP, I'm not sure why but the only explanation is that the terrible Windows vista home factory install form HP is messing up everything, while in rest with absolutely no programs running not even the messenger Vista have almost 70 process running that takes about 65% of the physical memory (more than 600 MB) just for the background programs and services, Vista freezes  all the time while burning a DVD which is bad, or just web browsing which is even worst, the Acer works great with XP with very little problems from time to time but nothing that a good tune up can't fix.  After trying Linux Ubuntu Ultimate at work I found that this is not a very friendly OS mostly when I try to make it work with some application that I use daily or when installing new drivers or some programs that just don't work, but Ubuntu give me the stability that Vista can't offer and I'm more then willing to learn how to deal with Linux just to show Microsoft the finger and move on to a different OS, or you can always downgrade to Windows XP and wait for Microsoft to fix the millions of problems that Vista have, personally I don't think SP1 for Vista is going to do much for an OS that relies in taking so much resources from hardware, I rather use those resources for my programs and applications to run stable and smoothly.	2.0	3.208199977874756

not what I expected  I knew this was a reconditioned computer, but it ran very slow and locked up on me several times. I also have an HP and don't ever have this same problem and both computers were in the same room.  Wasn't what I really expected from an Apple	1.0	1.0420515537261963
Stay away from this laptop...  This is one of the worst laptops ever made. Its a tempting price but not worth the hassle afterwords. First you should know that Dell came out with several more models later because this one had major hardware issues. The internal on-board ethernet/wifi chip or card will go bad in a few months, the signal would get shorter and shorter. There's a major battery chip problem as well which was supposedly fixed in later models. Hard drive problems, audio problems ...horrible. Just stay away, buy anything else but this.	2.0	1.9248874187469482
Shoulda been better  I waited for this model because of the hi-res screen.  Unit arrived with some dead pixels that my eyes seized upon and won't stop seeing. I'd thought the days of putting up with dead pixels were long over. Amazon -- terrifyingly good service -- is sending me another unit, though I tried too late to stop them, as I have gotten nervous about this machine.  Question: Does anyone else find that the screen, however fabulous the sharpness, doesn't LOOK good? There is something about the image --- a lack of contrast, no true blacks, a lack of depth, and even a sort-of purplishness (no matter how I adjust IT or ME), that makes me hate it. I keep looking back at my old trusty Asus 9" screen, and my newer Acer 10" screen (both 1024 x 600), and their image is markedly BETTER, lower resolution notwithstanding. As much as I lust after higher resolution, I would rather look at their images. Anyone else feel that way? Or do I have bad screen?  Now, regarding the 1005PR I am also a bit unhappy about how LOW the screen sits, altho I can see that this is a compromise to make the closed unit as small as possible. (The Acer, for example, is hinged in a way that puts the screen up high, but adds a hair front-to-back in the closed unit.)  Also, I find the keyboard to be okay, but just okay. The keys are spongy and the facade "gives" too much, making a slight-but-annoying rattling noise.  Lastly, the compy has trouble recognizing my ethernet connection. Each time I pull up Internet Explorer, it says there is a network problem and I need to reload the page a few times before it behaves (then it's fine). I've not had any such problem with other machines.  If you add up all the features, this netbook is a super value for the money. But in its sum, it is disappointing to use.  PS I do not have Broadcom either --- see screenshot [...]	2.0	2.9994068145751953
Apple Macbook  I was once a college freshman looking for a laptop that is powerful, portable, and affordable; and this Macbook does just that. The computer has a 13.3'' screen that is large enough to see the papers you write in Word and small enough to be portable. I've even had people comment to me about how small my computer is compared to others. Another thing about the design is the how cool it looks. For the build of the product, I've take my Macbook on planes all the time, take it to and fro class in my book bag, and even had accidentally someone drop it about 2ft onto a solid floor, and yet it still holds up the same way I bought the Apple. A lot of people often stay away from Apple computers because Microsoft has it planted in the consumers' heads that no software runs on Apple, that's a lie Microsoft. I use the computer for music, video, typing reports, and surfing the net. I find that Apple does a better job than Microsoft in those areas. You have Garage Band, which is great if you're interested in making a virtual band, and IMovie that lets you edit movies, but without the learning curve required in Adobe Premier. There's IWeb, which is similar to Dreamweaver but again without the steep learning curve. Then for those Microsoft people out there, you can put Microsoft Office on your Mac. The only fault I can see with the Macbook is that it can get a tad warm, however it's nothing extreme. The laptop is very quiet, bring it to a library and no one will even hear the computer running.  To conclude this review, the Macbook is a powerful, portable, and affordable laptop that is great for anyone in need of a laptop. This Macbook has a fast 2.0 GHz Core 2 Duo, amazing OS, small in size and at a great price.  *If you're a student, check for deals Apple will give you on their laptops. I was lucky enough to get $100 off the computer, free $100 printer, and free 2gig Ipod Mini.	5.0	5.000918865203857
decent for an auxiliary tv  I got this tv to replace an aging 5 inch B&W SD TV in our bathroom.  We use this TV for watching traffic and weather as we're getting ready for work.  Beyond that, I wouldn't recommend this TV.  This unit does have a good tuner, nice remote, and the ability to position the screen is great.  The downsides include are a poor picture (bright enough, but a lot of pixelation of colors) and abysmal sound (the sound is tinny/harsh and has a constant hum in the background)	3.0	3.025996685028076
BUY A NEW ONE NOT A USED ONE  Purchased a used one in March 2016, already has to use warranty I purchased separately. I paid 178.00 for it but I have not been pleased with it since I purchased it. Less than 6 months and computer doesn't have sound, screen freezing and sometimes it doesn't come on at all. The warranty only covers it up to 175.00 if it needs to be replaced. I will never buy a used computer again.	2.0	2.03205943107605
Awesome performance  I used all the time windows, always crash the system and viruses never were gone, now I have my macbook and is the best buy ever!!!

DV6810us RUNS WAY TOO HOT + DVD DRIVE NOISY!  Beware!  This laptop generates a lot of heat underneath, and on the palm rest.  I don't like heat too much and I bought this laptop to use to watch movies and surf the web in my bedroom.  Also, the DVD drive is very noisy.  Additionally, the AC adapter gets SO HOT that it would burn my children if they were to accidentally touch it.  Otherwise, the display was ok and it only took me about 2 hours to downgrade to XP and get everything working.  I returned it and suffered a $102 restocking fee, but I bought the Toshiba A215-S5837 and it was ~ $100 cheaper so in the end I broke even and got a much quieter and cooler running laptop.	2.0	2.0049943923950195
Great for what I wanted!  I have a larger HP laptop that I use to work from home. Because its large (so that the kids can watch movies when we travel) and its hooked up to all my peripherals (keyboard, printer, back up, etc), its been a hassle to unplug when I want to work at the java joint. Further,  I have wanted to do some fiction writing, but don't want to sit at my work computer to do it. So I bought the ASUS as I thought it would meet my needs for a portable, affordable way to write somewhere other than my home office.  I retrospect, I probably should have bought the 4g one for the additional space. But it didn't come in green. I have a writing program that needs windows to run so by the time I loaded XP and the program, there was little room for anything else (windows likes to have 200 mb free space).  However, I do love it. It jumps online with no problems. The Linux setup with OpenOffice and other sources already on it worked great and I would have kept it if I could have run my writing program. It has 3 usb ports so I'm able to plug in a mouse and flash drive. It has a slot for a SD card as well. I bought the 4g SD card to go with it. Using the card or a flash drive I can move between the ASUS and my regular laptop easily.  The keyboard is small but that's what you get for wanting a small laptop. The only trouble I've had with it is that sometimes I hit the arrow up key instead of the shift key.  The ASUS offers a great little system for an affordable price. I wouldn't expect to run a business on it or have too many applications. But if you're looking for something portable that you can use to access the Internet or write documents, its a nice little system.	4.0	4.067605495452881

Limited documentation  I have a secured WIFI in my home, but this ASUS computer can not access it. [Three other computers do not have a problem with accessing it and neither do other people visiting with their own laptops or two wireless printers.]  The ASUS documentation is limited.  The verbatim steps given to sign on to a wireless network are: "3. Select the wireless access point you want to connect to from the list and click 'Connect' to build the connection.  Ensure that the box before 'Enable wireless' is checked. "4. When connecting, you may have to enter a password. "5. After a connection has been established, the connection is shown on the list."  Please note that the documentation assumes that one will never have a problem establishing a connection since it does not offer any suggestions or diagnostics if (as in my case)the connection lands in a indefinite state of "CONNECTION PENDING." Call the help desk?  No telephone number or on-line help address is provided anywhere.  To obtain this closely held corporate trade secret, I had to contact the vendor. Forty-eight hours after I sent an e-mail, the vendor sent me the elusive telephone number -- which of course is limited to only Monday through Friday, 9:00 PM TO 9:00 PM [Your guess is as good as mine as to the time zone for the ASUS service center.]  Don't bother asking about whose nickle pays for the call. Reflective of the customer-be-damned orientation, it is not a toll free number.  So be prepared to run up a lot of minutes waiting for the help desk response.  To ASUS' credit (after a lengthy telephone call during which the help desk had to transfer me to a software enginner employed by the operating system provider), I got connected to the WIFI at my house. Since that one time, I have been unable to do so.  And I don't think that the software engineer really knew what was the problem or what magical trick finally solved it.  And lest you think that I have an esoteric off-brand WIFI system, the router is a very generic Netgear from Staples.  I want to return the item and go back to a local brick-and-mortar national chain and get a device that is designed to toss into a suitcase so one can merely check e-mail and access the internet while traveling.  This or course means a capability to access the widest variety of WIFI networks.  I thought that was the purpose behind this ASUS laptop, but someone forget about the importance for connectivity.  My problem is that there is a security block on the network at my house (which I do not know about) that the ASUS machine can not get around.  And no one (the vendor, the manufacturer, the manufacturer's subcontractors or myself) knows how to diagnose or solve the problem.	1.0	1.030508279800415
It was so great until it won't turn on at all  I bought this laptop a few months ago. Even though it has a bunch of useless pre-programs, I was pretty satisfied with this machine.  However, tragic disaster happened to me in this morning. I saw Asus launched many new version of drivers for this on their official website, so I downloaded them including New Version of BIOS. It was completely well done to upgrade New Version of BIOS, 203, but after finished upgrading that, it shut down automatically. And then it didn't turn on at all.  I'm not an idiot to confuse downloading wrong version of BIOS.  I pushed the power button too many times but it just didn't work at all. So I had to call Service center, the guy told me it would take more than 2 weeks to fix my new laptop.  Now I'm so depressed and angry about the stupid New Version of BIOS. On their website, I cann't find any warning sentence or sign about upgrading BIOS of my laptop. So if you have any plan to upgrade your Bios in your laptop, I strongly recommend you not to do that.	2.0	1.8348568677902222
The best laptop in the market  I had a Powerbook before this laptop. I was happy with that, but I couldn't stop my desires to have this beauty when I saw it! It is incredibly sleek, fast and flawless! Another insane product from Apple!	5.0	4.549728870391846
Maybe  This computer was okay for me at first. But after less than a year, now it's having some major problems. It holds a charge with the new charger I had to buy(the old one broke easily) but it will not charge itself. The charger also falls out easily(as it did with the original charger as well). I had to buy a new battery for it, but it turns out that wasn't the problem. I now have to by a new charger for it, but I don't think that's going to be the problem either as the charger is managing to make the laptop stay on.  I think it's actually that piece that you connect the charger into on the computer. And if it is, I have no idea how to fix that. Not to mention I've already spent over 100$ trying to find out what's wrong with this thing.  Far too many problems for being less than a year old. Not to mention, it's running Vista(granted, sadly, all computers are nowadays).	3.0	3.0166776180267334
LOVE IT!  I just adore this laptop!  I am a recent convert to Mac and treated myself to the 17 inch MacBook Pro when I first opened my small business earlier this year.  I liked it a lot so bought myself this small 13 inch to use at home and to carry on business trips.  Well, I soon found myself completely attached to this smaller machine.  It is lightweight and has a battery that lasts an impressively long time. I can carry it anywhere and be set up to go in a flash, wherever there is a wireless connection.  And the speed of the wireless is terrific!  I also purchased an Airport Extreme and am now running my home network through its new, faster n standard.  I have an old digital camera that was a huge hassle to use with Windows.  I had to download software and there were always glitches when I tried to upload photos from the camera card.  Now, with the MacBook's iPhoto, no software is necessary.  I just plug the camera into the laptop via a USB connector and the software does the rest.  I had pretty much given up on digital photography, but now find that I am using the camera a lot and easily sharing pictures with friends over the Web.  The only drawback to this laptop is that it gets quite hot when it's in use for awhile.  (I've noticed that happens with my MacBook Pro too, as well as with other laptops I've had. But the Pro doesn't present a problem because I don't use it on my lap because it's a bit too large for comfort).  So I purchased a lightweight, insulated lap pad and now I have no problem keeping the MacBook on my lap for hours.  I am incredibly enthused about the 13 inch MacBook and highly recommend it to everyone.  It is a great value for the price.  I only wish I had converted to Mac sooner.	5.0	4.991450309753418

Great Notebook  First time Mac owner/user. After many frustrations with PC and the instability of its operating system, I switched to a Mac. No regrets about that. The bundled iLife software with this product allow a novice Mac user the chance to work with digital music and photo without the frustration of application incompatibility. Its software performance between applications is nearly seamless.	5.0	5.027339458465576
You get what you pay for  I like the small size.  However, the poor resolution (800x480) of the screen makes it hard for normal internet usage.  One would assume the flash drive would make the PC run very fast, but it seem to run as slow as any other sub-$300 laptop.  Finally the battery life should be a LOT longer than a normal laptop since it has no moving parts, but it doesn't last very long.  Next time I will just spend a little bit more and buy a laptop without the limitations this one has.	3.0	3.0450663566589355

Easy Use, Easy Setup, Inexpensive bought  2nd one  FEBRUARY 29, 2008....This is an update one year after purchasing this laptop.  Six months ago upgraded it to 2.0gb ram and it works even better... it has never crashed on me.  In August of 07, I purchased another one for my son which now includes a DVD burner.  Had one glitch right after purchase, but when I updated the drivers and updated vista it ran fine.  Great inexpensive laptop especially when upgrading the ram to 2.0gb.  Would still recommend.  I purchased this laptop and feel very satisfied with all the features, it even has a 56k modem for dialup (unfortunately my only option where I live).  Some of the features not listed above are a LAN connection plug, 3usb ports, headphone jack, microphone jack, plus S-Video and SVGA output.  It was very easy to set up; it recognized all my add-ons, ergonomic usb keyboard, wireless usb trackball, usb multifunction laser printer, 2 usb hubs, and an emergency usb controlled battery backup.  This laptop runs pretty fast and even more with a RAM module upgrade.  I have taken it out to try out the built in wireless and it worked flawlessly.  The widescreen is a great feature and has a beautiful picture. The laptop is not too heavy especially comparing it to my old PIII 500 and even fits in to my old targus notebook case (did not think it would because of the widescreen).  Some of the things it does not have are a firewire connection, a DVD burner, and PCMIA slots.  I burn my DVDs at home and just about every add-on is USB so I am not sorry at all for choosing this laptop.  This is my first experience with a windows vista system to which I was a bit apprehensive about but it was pretty easy to adjust from windows XP and did not encounter any problems.  For the price and features this makes a great buy.	4.0	4.0403218269348145

Functionable Laptop  I got this thing used a few years ago; now, I'm a 16 year-old, and my primary use for computers is writing, storing my photos, and gaming. This laptop is pretty decent (especially for the price) for the first two of my purposes, but for gaming, it was way, way below par. We had to buy numerous upgrades for it to even run World of Warcraft on top of my pictures (they take up a lot of memory).  BOTTOM LINE: If you're looking for a low-key laptop and you don't need much memory, this is a nice little piece of hardware.	3.0	3.816295862197876
Nice Screen; Good Features; Terrible Build Quality  I was convinced this would be a great notebook.  Very good features for the price.  The screen is really quite amazing.  However, from the start, the computer feels a bit on the cheap side.  The battery jiggles a little in its housing, giving the whole computer a somewhat ramshackle feel... as if it is about to break... and lo, it did...  multiple times so far.  Sony really needs to work on the build quality.  I was happy for the first two weeks, then my problems began.  1.  2 weeks into owning it, the computer wouldn't turn on without a reset of holding the power button for 30 seconds.  2.  4 weeks in, the DVD-RW drive started to work intermittently, then not at all.  3.  8 weeks in, the power gave out completely.  The machine won't turn on.  Sony's in-home service has been OK (will have my 3rd visit this week), but waiting 2-4 days for service has been incredibly inconvenient.	1.0	2.855860471725464

Good but could be lots better  Small and portable. Slow to boot up. Comes with essentially no instructions, not even for Windows Vista. Does take a long time to update online. I also object to the use of 'demo' packages for many software items. It looks to me that this computer is designed as a sales pitch for buying lots of software that used to come already installed (and DOES on many competing models. It is light and portable, but the $2000+ price is just the down-payment.	4.0	3.2067182064056396
Went back to my T42  I apologize to those reviewers who clearly fell in love with this machine but the reliability factor just was not there. If you poke about Amazon you will find I wrote a review of the T42 which was fairly popular, I suggested it was (AND MAYBE STILL IS) the best deal on the used computer market (for everything but HD graphics) and suggested how to update the unit for modern use. I have currently 4 T42s in a network, and they are more fun than a barrel of hammers. However, realizing that time was moving inexorably on, I could not resist picking up a T61 at what appeared to be a bargain price. The specs are to die for, right? The unit had merely "normal" use for its age (not a spring chicken) and the hard drive was checked with a sector by sector utility, so I figured I was in good shape. Wrong. First disappointment was the screen. What were they thinking? Sounds good on paper, especially next to the T42 but in real life the T42 display was a superb example of old tech whereas the T61 is a poor example of new tech. Strike one. The hinges truly suck as the other reviewers say. They suck on an order of magnitude that is staggering and this in spite of the fact they are oversized. Raises serious issue about Lenovo's competency. Strike two. The fan needed to be replaced (did it ever) but to some extent this was my error, I forgot, when testing, to warm the machine up first. Replaced it myself, medium complexity, especially the routing of the wires. Additional research shows the fans do not last as long as earlier models. So we are already at 3 strikes. The internal mic did not work unless (trial and error) I inserted a male plug into the mic jack (any plug, did not matter) and removed it. Annoying. Spent hours trying to solve this frustrating issue AND THEN IN LATE 2012 A FULL 6 YEARS AFTER THE MODEL WAS INTRODUCED THEY RELEASED A FIX. The new driver solved the issue but 6 years? What are they smoking at Lenovo? As this is written, the T61 is still having battery issues (system reports all systems OK but the battery dies in 18 minutes) but is otherwise OK. I am writing this review on one of my T42s. Thats really all you need to know.	1.0	2.945478916168213

Possible solution for the Black Screen Problem (or blank screen)  If you are running VISTA, try going to the Power Options, advanced options, processor power management, and change the value of the minimum processor state to 100%.

Five Stars if it was not loaded with bloatware & no OS media  I own this machine and like it very much. When one spends several thousand on a Vaio it should not be filled with useless trail software. It took hours to remove. It never comes off completely as there is no incentive to write the uninstall so that it removes all the files. Sony builds fine hardware but has many problems in writing good software for peripherals. When I bought this machine the was no option to buy without the junk software. The other problem is that SONY DOES NOT GIVE YOU DISK MEDIA FOR THE OS. The OS is on a hidden drive. I bought this computer knowing the junk software but was surprised by the lack of OS media considering I paid 150.00 xtra for Vista Ult. I really question as to whether I would buy another.	2.0	2.0164215564727783
Stunning, powerful, reliable  The iBook, Apple's "consumer" portable (a consumer simply being an everyday user), really has it all now: a very speedy processor, great graphics, great design (it took a few years for them to perfect this white beauty), great features (a lazy way of saying "All the other things on the machine I forgot to mention"), and most importantly, a great price. Ever since the iBook went G4, the machine took on a whole transformation. It is no longer lacking in the processor department and thus is a very "well-rounded" laptop. As for the machine itself, it's great. The entire laptop is white, crisp white (a mixed blessing...it's elegant, but very, very hard not to dirty it), and the overall design is great. Everything is ergonomical and compact: the little latch to close the iBook stays hidden on the top, but then magically appears as you close it. (Gotta love Apple's design team for those little things!) The keyboard, unlike other models, isn't "spongy."In fact, it is rather sturdy for a laptop keyboard. It is stationed to a strong metal backboard and if you take the keyboard and backboard off, you will see a slot for an Airport Extreme card (card that enables wireless internet). No more PC "NIT" cards protruding from the sides, everything is on the inside. The top of the computer has a translucent Apple logo that glows when you are computing in the dark. The trackpad is large and precise, and the button (Windows users, beware: no "Left-clicking" in the Mac world, only "Command clicking"!) is large and responsive. Battery life is excellent, I get an average of 5 hours with normal use. The charger has a light indicating the level of charge so you know when the 'book is charged (green for charged, amber for charging) without turning it on or waking it from its "Sleep" mode. Panther, the latest version of Mac OS X (10.3), is stunning, powerful, and reliable in its own right (go ahead and check out those reviews or Jaguar's reviews, the previous OS X version.) I don't want to go into the benefits of its UNIX core, just trust me that it is stable. The "iLife" set of software is one that really revolutionized the Apple world, after OS X, software-wise. It's all here: iTunes (store, burn, and buy music in one easy-to-use program), iPhoto (organize, burn, share, print, edit, email, and more with a plug-and-play friendly piece of software), iMovie (for editing, storing, and organizing your DV movies), but no iDVD...no DVD burner (but you can buy an external one.) Some other good programs that supplement your iLife are Mail, Appleworks, iChat, iCal, etc. It comes with World Book 2003, Quicken, and a few others. It's fast. CD's burn with one click. My iPod (a great addition to this for music lovers) loads with one slide of a Firewire cable (literally.) Safari has built-in pop-up control (never has a single pop-up existed here.) Games (only the Sims so far) load and play flawlessly. DVD watching is pristine. USB 2.0 and Firewire (a BIG plus for external hard drives) work at top speed. No bugs, no crashes, no viruses. This machine was engineered to have the software and hardware be integrated. Have a problem? You won't be told to call a different company.

impressive specs for the price  This machine had some problems with freeze-ups when it was first introduced earlier this year, but it appears that Toshiba has finally worked out most of those issues. in addition, the new 100gb 5400rpm hard drive is impressive!  Pros:  - Attractive design - thinner and more eye-pleasing than M35/M35X predecessor  - Exceptional sound from built-in speakers, though deeper bass is lacking  - Quiet keyboard with easy-to-depress keys, though see issues below  - TruBrite display produced excellent images  - Touchpad is smooth and has good tactile feel  - Sonoma platform with 533MHz FSB  - Solid WiFi performance  - Wide array of connectivity options: 3 USB 2.0 ports, FireWire, SD/MMC/xD/MS/MS Pro Media Card slot  - Very quiet and cool to the touch - fan came on rarely and made a pleasant sound when running  - Toshiba power management and system management software: Touch and Launch, Acoustic Silencer, graphical WiFi utility  - S-Video (TV Out) for connection to projectors and TVs  Cons:  - TruBrite display exhibits lots of glare, though this is common on nearly all glossy LCD's  - Lacks DVI output and Express Card  - Display exhibits too much flex and seems fragile  - Poor 3D performance due to integrated graphics and shared memory  - Below Average Battery life  - Slower 333MHz DDR memory rather than newer 533MHz DDR2 memory, though lower latency (CL 2.5) generally compensates for slower speed  - Keyboard seems slightly cramped and is shifted to the right rather than centered; dedicated Windows key is inconveniently located in upper-right area of keyboard  - Relatively low-resolution 1280 x 800 display (98 PPI), though TruBrite has good color & contrast	4.0	4.020586967468262

Not perfect but close to it...  I've had my TX-650 for about 3 weeks. The first thing I did was put a 1GB RAM card in to boost the total RAM to 1.5GB. It's easy to do yourself and for less than $100 is worth in in better performance.  Overall I have been pretty happy with the device. The screen is very nice, the size and weight are just perfect. The keyboard is as good as you are going to get in a ultraportable. The battery life is superb. I have had occasion to use the wireless LAN a lot and the reception is excellent. I also subscribed to the Cingular EDGE WWAN plan and the speed is poor but better than nothing if you are stuck without a WLAN nearby.  I'm not happy with the lack of restore disks and the fact that a fairly large part of the HD is taken up by restore files and thus unusable.  I've also had intermittent problems with the sleep/hibernate feature causing lock-ups.  Another negative is the fan noise. Expect the fan to run at least 50% of the time if you use it for longer than 10 minutes.  Overall a great little notebook and I would buy it again.	4.0	3.6579997539520264
Would not recommend.  I deleted my original, 5-star review. I know this particular model is no longer available, but if my experience is any indication, you should think hard before buying a Toshiba laptop, especially a lower-end model. I had the Satellite 1415-S173 for three years -- during the first year I had it, it blew a hard drive (thankfully under warranty). I had it fixed and less than a week later, it blew another hard drive. This time it went back to Toshiba to be fixed. All was more or less well for the next two years, when a Windows problem shut the thing down completely. I took my data out of it and switched back to a Mac. I am sick of Windows' unreliability, susceptibility to viruses and other problems, and the masking-tape-and-chewing-gum nature of patching together Windows machines just in order to make them function. BUT -- more to the point, the computer had inherent problems, first and foremost being the cheap desktop processor Toshiba uses (or used) in their lower-end laptops. This machine got incredibly hot and I was told this is probably what killed my first 2 hard drives. If you have one of these machines, I highly recommend a cooling platform which is probably the only thing that kept my laptop running for an additional 2 years. It's a shame, because aside from being very heavy and having a weak battery charge (1.5 hours at best), this laptop was attractive and easy to use with a nice bright display. But ultimately -- not a good value -- at $1,200 I don't consider it a "cheap" machine by any means, and certainly not when compared to my (less expensive) iBook.	2.0	1.9458892345428467
my first Mac and my first laptop  Since the age of 5, I've been a PC girl (both my parents work in the industry).  I knew I wanted a laptop, but I went back and forth between switching to a Mac and staying comfortable with a PC.  In the end, I bought the MacBook.  With 100GB of storage, it has just as much room as my old desktop!  Everytime I turn it on, I am amazed at home fast it boots up.  The features are great.  The built-in camera is great - I've had video chats with many of my relatives that haven't seen my new apartment yet and have taken them on a virtual tour!  All the preloaded programs are really great, especially if you dabble in photography or video.  I've had it for two months now, and I haven't had a single problem with it.  And the adjustment period from PC to Mac was very minimal.  I was 100% comfortable using the MacBook within a couple hours.  I'm still continuing to discover new Mac tricks that make things so much faster and easier!  I definitely recommend getting one of these even if you are a little anxious about going Mac.  It's well worth the money!!	5.0	4.998252868652344

An excellent compact, desktop, you can take with you.  The key to this machine is understanding what it is. It is a compact footprint desktop with a built in UPS. If you think of it that way you will be very happy with it. If you're out to buy a kick butt gaming laptop so that you can frag your way from Los Angeles to New York, don't get this machine. This machine has a lot going for it, very nice 3D performance, very nice ergonomics, clear bright screen, zippy P4 performance, and you can burn your own DVDs on it. All very nice. Ports are somewhat limited (3 USB + ethernet + firewire + parallel and VGA) but you get back your serial port of you buy the port replicator. For a limited time Sony is giving away WiFi cards if you send them a copy of your reciept and serial #. Sony now offers this notebook with WinXP pro (the GRV680P) and you should get that as its the same price ... and XP Pro gives you some nice server like features. The not so nice part is that clearly this machine will be orphaned quickly. I say this because soon the only laptops worth buying will have WiFi built in, systems without it will become like laptops without Ethernet two years ago. The software was somewhat thrown together as well. The built in CD-burning application (drag & drop CD) works, but if you try to use the "built in" XP software for dealing with writable CD's it doesn't work. Other issues arise when you try to use it as a portable machine. First, the machine draws 100 watts. That means you can't really power it from an airplane power socket without blowing the circuit breaker. Second, the second battery (needed if you want to have long run time) requires that you remove the DVD drive. That means no games while you are "mobile." However, if you get a piece of code that "emulates" a CDROM drive using a disk image on the hard drive you can get by, and the generous hard drive makes that practical. It also weighs a ton with two batteries in it so if you're going to do this get the Sony VAIO back pack to carry the thing. Holding it over your shoulder will give you back pains. There is a slot for a memory stick. That's great if you're into memory sticks but of little use to those who have cameras with CF slots or USB disk drives. All that being said, if you are someone who has a small home office, or a desk that you use for both writing and email. Or you are a student who wants to be able to use their computer in the library or the dorm without all the cabling hassle. This is the machine for you. It is completely capable of running all of todays applications (from games, to spreadsheets, to databases) and it offers excellent data storage capacity and connectivity. Like many (most?) portables today it does not come with a floppy but it will read/write CDR's and CD-RWs, as well as DVDs (send a video this year a christmas rather than a letter!) and the fact that everything was designed to work together means no annoying driver/motherboard/OS compatability issues to deal with.	4.0	4.066574573516846
I like it......a lot.  Well, where do I start? Not with my last 2 HP laptop disasters, or with my recently deceased Hitachi notebook. The Compaq is my last hope for a great notebook, and 2 weeks into it, I'm encouraged. To start with, it looks great. It's silver and sleek and svelte, at least compared to my HP (Omnibook 6000). All the Compaq's stuff is in the right place, with a 3.5" floppy drive & a PCMIA slot on one side, and the very acceptable DVD/CD-RW on the other. All the other connections (including 2 USB ports & a network interface port) are on the back, where they should be. In fact, when not connected to its home-based wires, the whole panel hides behind a plastic hinged door, a cheap but effective solution. The processor is the very capable Athalon 1.4, every bit as good as the Intel PIII mobile. Graphics are okay (a bigger graphics memory would make this a better gaming machine) and the screen is unusually sharp. The 256K RAM needs to be doubled(there is controvery re: whether it will only take 384 or 512) and the 20 Meg hard drive is just adequate, but these are not major drawbacks. This is overall a wonderful machine by a company that looks like it's here to stay.	5.0	4.663423538208008
You won't regret it  Even though this laptop came out towards the end of 2006 it still can do everything most people would want a laptop to do. This laptop would not be good for someone who wants to play up to date games though. You can not find a new laptop that is as good looking or as well made unless you go with a newer macbook pro. Laptop has a wonderful keyboard and great screen. No one would ever guess it's almost 10 years old. Mac os 10.6.8 is what im currently using but this particular model of macbook can run up to 10.7.5 but if you know what you're doing you can get this laptop to run any version of windows from xp all the way up to 10 providing years more of software support.	5.0	3.4921059608459473

Love my apple iBook Laptop 14.1  I read all the reviews before purchasing the Apple iBook Laptop.  The Apple computer company shipped my computer quickly and was securely packaged for shipping.

Very happy will the 3 computers I purchased.	5.0	5.026741027832031
Did not come with Windoxs XP  The only problem I had was that it did not have Windows XP on it as advertised. It had some os call unbutu on it. So, instead of the hassle of returning it. I just decided to try to use it. I particularly wanted XP, because I was use to it and like the features. But the computer works fine.	3.0	2.1443865299224854
great overall  I was initially hesitant to buy this laptop because of the heat and fan complaints.  However I'm glad I did.  It does get hot, and the fan does turn on frequently, but it's nothing unbearable.  But then again I don't put it directly on my lap much.  What do you expect when you have a fast processor and graphics card in such a small unit.  I love the display (bright, crisp) and the build quality.  The size and weight are great except for the giant AC adapter.  My only really complaint is that the battery only lasts 2.5 hours, which is not great for a light and thin model.  Additionally Sony is proprietary with regards to parts, so it's hard to find a cheap extended battery.  Overall I very pleased though.	5.0	4.084228038787842

A solid buy........  Let me start by saying that my sole experience with laptops have been with IBM. That being said I was looking for a replacement for my old IBM and one that would be capable of acting as both a desktop and mobile. I started as most do by comparing a number of models, Dell, Gateway, HP, Compaq etc.. The final decision came down to 2 main points extended warranty and price. The capabilities of the machine came last as most are quite adequate for general use in this price range. First I will start off with price, I was able to buy the 1415 for $...with rebates. All other models reviewed with the same features would run 2-3 hundred dollars more. The second reason was the extended factory warranty offered by Toshiba ( a must have on any mobile device ) was far more comprehensive and less expensive then the competition. I like the fact that it is a factory warranty and not a 3rd party vendor. Since buying the 1415 in early December it has performed quite well with no issues, acting as both my desktop and mobile device. On the one occasion I spoke with Toshiba to look for updates they were EXCELLENT! As a desktop I have connected a 17 inch Samsung LCD monitor and wireless Logitech keyboard/mouse along with a USB hub making it a simple matter of connecting or removing 2 plugs. All in all a great machine, my only complaint was( No Track Ball ); a left over issue from using and IBM but solved by carrying a optical mouse in my bag. If it were not for that I would have rated it a 5 star.	4.0	4.746729850769043
Good Things Do Come in Small Packages!  This is not the pc if you want a standalone do everything PC. It is a PC that is built for the mobile traveler or business person. To get on the net fast and to maintain your personal or business contacts. My Asus PC has no problem accessing the free Wi-fi in my area. The Linux system is clean and very fast with very few crashes. Linux automatically recognizes sll of the USB add-ons that I have thrown at it and it boots up very fast. I am pleased with this lightweight and durable PC (Yes, I have dropped it a few times in its neoprene case and it still works!) I would recommend the Asus EEE PC at it's $399 price.	4.0	3.274972438812256
MacBook basics  It doesn't get any easier to upgrade from an old and very tired Powerbook Titanium to a smooth, shiny new MacBook. Just run a Firewire cable between the two and in a very short time you are up and running a fast and easy to use computer with all of the data from the old machine easily accessible. The way that the Mac OS handles information, the 120 GB hard drive provides plenty of space for everything a person would normally do with a personal computer. If I were doing commercial graphic designing or commercial video work I would probably get a MacBook Pro, but for personal work this is much more than a normal person needs.	4.0	4.0631818771362305
VAIO Review  So far so good - i am playing and learning.  the system comes with an over abundance of programs and it takes a while to get all the extra junk off there - i only have 6gb of space until i get everything 'extra' cleared of.

Mobile Powerhouse for Professionals  This thing does it all. It allows you to go from home den/work space to office seamlessly, never having to turn it off. It has completely replaced my more powerful PC. Five stars.  Here's some advice, though:  - Get the extended battery. Battery life is arguably the greatest downfall for this mini-titan. With the screen on full brightness (you can choose to dim the screen while on battery) you'll only get about an hour of life before you have to recharge. DESPITE what Sony tells you. The extended battery is physically bigger but allows for a better grip (though weighs more as well). I can't tell you how much it extends the battery off the top of my head (though Sony boasts 1.5 times more), but I haven't had to change batteries since I got it.  - Buy the screen protectors. The screen can and will collect dirt often; so if you decide to pass on these then prepare to invest in some LCD cleaning solution.  - The keyboard can be very cumbersome to work with, especially with extended use. As an alternative buy the Think Outside Universal Bluetooth Keyboard (just type that into Amazon). It communicates with the Vaio wirelessly saving that one USB slot for something else. Plus it's the same width as the Vaio, and folds up -- it's ultra mobile!  - While you're at it invest in a decent travel-size bluetooth mouse (preferably with rechargeable batteries). With the keyboard and mouse it'll feel like you're on a regular (albeit micro) PC.  - Invest in a nice padded bag to carry it in. The case the vaio sits in is nice for a protective skin but you'll want something sturdier for your investment.  - When you tuck your Vaio away to travel from one place to the other (from the office to home, for example) be sure to put it in Hibernate Mode. If you don't (and choose Standby or Power Saver) the heat sensor will kick in, turning on the fan, which will overheat it and drain the battery even more (with the running fan).  The max resolution it can have on an external monitor is 1600x1200. It can play 3D games such as Star Wars: Empire at War and Warcraft III fairly smoothly (though on lowst graphics setting).	5.0	4.98344087600708

Great laptop but HDMI is fauty  I have no problems with the laptop. The laptop is extremely fast and I'm satisfied with it. but the only thing bad about this laptop is that the HDMI does not output audio. which means that if you were like me and hoped to be able to watch blu ray on an hdtv by hooking up the laptop to the tv via hdmi, will not get the sound to play on the tv. The laptop image gets sent to the tv, but the sound only comes out of the laptop speaker and will not come out of the tv speaker.  I called Sony support and after 2 hours dealing with their technicians they admited that there is a problem with their products and hdmi, and that their engineers were "working" on a solution, maybe a future patch. but researching this problem online i found that another vaio user had the same problem around Jan 2008 and he was told that they were working on fixing this issue then and it's nearly been a year!  like i said, i'm 100% satisfied with every other aspect of the laptop, especially for the deal i got at the time, but i'm dissapointed with the hdmi issue since one of the reasons i bought the laptop is so that i could use it as a blu ray player and not have to spend $200+ on one.	3.0	3.166098117828369

Cute!  Awesome little computer  I was so excited to get the ASUS, got mine in pink, only had it for about a month now. This thing is SO fast on the internet, amazing!  I have had a few incidents where it simply would not connect to wireless, which was a huge problem when it was times I was trying to use it for work.  It was a bit weird using the tiny keyboard at first, I have large hands for a woman, but got used to it pretty well.  I was so amazed that I could plug in my flash drive, edit a Microsoft Word doc, and save it. That was awesome, seeing that the ASUS does not have MS Office! If you're going to be out and about, be sure you charge the battery to full before you go.  I'm not yet sure what max battery time I get because the times I have taken it out, I had not checked to be sure it was fully charged.  I also purchased the matching mouse through Amazon, but the company who sold it charged way too much for shipping/handling (my mistake for being the sucker to pay it) and they didn't deliver in the promised time frame.  I think you can get the matching mouse at Best Buy--do that!  Overall, if you're looking for a lightweight on-the-go computer for basic internet, email, etc. this is cute, fun, and functional!	4.0	4.004693031311035

BUYER BEWARE HP TX1420US  DO NOT buy an HP TX series computer. There is a known defect that HP denies on this model. GUI chip will overheat due to lack of cooling and cause computer to fail. Then you will pay to get it fixed as HP support will leave you hanging. Go to HP's own support forum and read the 100's of post. DO NOT BY. Buyer BEWARE. Don't join the 1000's of know owners that have already paid for the mistake you are about to make. First symptoms are computer running very hot then intermitant wirless connection followed by unexplained hibernation (with all hibernation and sleep modes turned off) then your computer will shutdown and never restart. No BIOS screen no boot screen nothing will work but the leds and fan.	1.0	1.0164246559143066
Good all round laptop  This laptop is a good laptop for gamers like myself and for business purposes. The Wireless reception on this laptop is great. I own a linksys wireless access point and the signal from the laptop is strong even if i am outside the house. The only problem i have with this laptop is that the burning the recovery cds for the laptop was not successful. The burning process failed twice for me when i attempted create backp cds. This is serious since the laptop does not come with cds but all the software is backed up on 5 gigs of your harddrive. What good is it if it cant be burn on to DVDs.

No more PCs for me!  I bought this out of frustration with PCs. My HP laptop had to be sent back to the manufacturer 3 times in a year and a half.  On the 3rd time, I ordered a this Macbook.  I wanted a dependable computer!  I had this computer up, running, and on the internet within 10 minutes out of the box!  I am still learning the short cuts to getting around.  I love the look of this laptop, the speed, and the ease of use.  I am a typical 30 something with basic to intermediate computer knowledge, but by no means a "techie".  I would highly recommend a Mac to someone looking for nice looking, easy to use, dependable computer.	5.0	4.604677677154541

EEE PC revisited  I must first apologize to Asus for my previous review - I had pretty thoroughly bashed the unit because of difficulties in getting the wireless working.  I found I was entering the wrong key for the WPA, hence my trouble.  I'm still not satisfied with Asus's tech support - but the fault was mine.  Here's my re-review.  I purchased this unit for work for use in our production area - we run an intranet web site where we're putting all of our work instructions.  Employees move from station to station to complete different jobs, and the ability to hand them a cheap web machine means they carry the work instructions with them (the convenience of paper), but always have the latest and greatest right there (Revision control for you ISO-9000 folks).  Now that I've corrected my thoroughly bone-headed mistake, I'll be putting this puppy through its paces over the next few weeks.  So far, however, it's definitely up to the challenge.	4.0	2.902174472808838
Avoid this Toshiba A135-S4527  Go to your favorite search engine and plug in this model and a choice keyword or two (Trouble" or "Problem" ought to do for starters).  I didn't want to believe that a Toshiba Notebook could be so bad, but it seems that the joyous reverie of other reviewers (I wish them well) is not universally echoed by owners everywhere. People are having awful problems with it shutting off spontaneously and then perversely not being able to shut it once it is running.  The Hitachi SATA hard drive dies on some owners. USB isn't working right for others.  Toshiba is uncooperative, the drivers for XP are darned hard to find, Vista crashes, on and on and on.  I can't vouch for all of these problems, maybe they're operator error or sunspots or alien abductions.  All I know is that mine is going back in the packaging and off to a service depot for a long rest, hopefully for the cure of two show-stopping problems (aforementioned dead disk after 4 months, and chronic shut down problems going back to since new).  Bon Voyage. l'il notebook. we hardly knew ye.  Caveat emptor.	2.0	1.63103449344635

****YOU MUST BUY EXTENDED WARRANTY*******  I bought a Satellite A135-S4527 1 year ago and my warranty just expired. I am very gentle with my laptop and the monitor went out. Toshiba tech support will not talk to you unless you give them a credit card and I have found that to replace the monitor (part alone) is $400 +. This is more than half the price of a new laptop. It doesnt make sense. So if you buy Toshiba get that extended warranty. Remember, when they sell something cheap its for a reason. Good luck	2.0	3.2458109855651855
Good notebook for the price  A bought this computer because was one of the best value for the money. The dual core processor is great, 1GB ram look like not enought using Windows Vista (just the OS use 780MB ) so if you plan to use heavy software, I think you need 2 gb for ram.  As usual on Toshiba come with recovery cd (other brand not include this anymore, you have to burn it from the HD), quick install guide, and documents about warranty and toshiba accesories.  The finished look very well, except for the BIG BIG brand name on the lid, maybe somebody like that, not me. The keyboard is white color, the screen is pretty bright so you don't have any problem reading with sunlight. The weight is the normal for a 15.4" notebook, like 6 pounds.  This unit don't come with Card reader, you can see the space for it, but not coming with this model. I thought that thing about just two USB ports was a lie but is true, this notebook just have two USB port on the left side, doesn't have TV out.

**** RETURNED ****  This Vaio has the potential to be a good notebook however my experience with it was horrible. Bought the machine for my wife thinking that the Sony / Vaio name gave me a better chance of finding something reliable.  #1 Sony load an incredible amount of bloatware, you probably need a couple of days to clear it all out before you load what you want on the machine. Uninstalls seem really slow on Vista.  #2 After doing #1 and setting up my wireless connection everything looks good. However whenever the Vaio goes into standby or hibernate on coming out of this mode I only have local network access and no internet access. Vista displays this by showing your home network as "Unidentified Network" Reboot and it works fine. Spent two to three days working on this, type "Vista Unidentified Network" into Google and you will see many similiar issues with Vista. Probably a bad driver, however I could not fix it.  From much reading on the web; Vaio and this problem are mentioned many times.  I just want something that works out of the box.  Still need a notebook for my wife not sure which way to go (XP?)	1.0	1.0177768468856812

Great Product  I am a recent Mac convert.  Got rid of my laptop and desktop PC's and am thrilled with both.  As far as the Macbook is concerned after two months of use I could not be happier.  The construction, ergonomics and lookds are near perfect.  The software:  Mac OS as opposed to Windows.  I Tried Vista on someone else's computer and was shocked how bad it is compared to mac os x.  Apple Macs are more expensive than the average PC but hey, you get what you pay for!  Update 11-18-09:  I gave this labtop to my son who in turn gave it to his cousin when he got a new Pro.  The machine after upgrading to Leopard still rocks.  It is still running flawless2 1/2 years later.  The kids have never had to re-install the OS, change any hardware, or had any viruses or infections of any kind.  Better than expected for an entry level Macbook.	5.0	5.011493682861328
Impressive but HOT!!!  This notebook booted up very fast and was generally the quickest Mac I have ever owned. But after a marathon 3 hour session in Photoshop one afternoon, got a blister on my left leg. That shocked me. Went to visit the Apple store and the Mac genius said that was normal. Well, not to me. Ended up selling it and bought a Sony FJ notebook and it runs way much cooler. Sorry Mac, you lost me on this one...	4.0	3.8366825580596924

Clear picture tough handling  The unit is an amazing device, small light with all the latest communication features, The keyboard is not easy to use, the keys are small and embedded, so hard to reach for my big fingers, i would suggest a blue tooth add-on. The screen fonts are so small that even with my reading glasses it is straining on the eyes. The hard drive came with a 30 GB partition, the extra 10 are unaccessible (unexplainable with such a small drive. The drive also came cluttered of trial software Which took a while to remove not without some glitches thanks to vista.  On the communication side it is exemplary all the latest tech is included and works well, one small problem for cingular wan, when traveling abroad you cannot use sim cards from other carrier so it is expensive to use, the device seemed locked to cingular network. Mine came without a user manual so i had to discover its workings the hard way. Blue tooth devices connected well, and the wifi worked fine. overall it is worth the price i paid for it on amazon.	3.0	3.99924635887146

Perfect Laptop  My fiance and I purchased this laptop for personal use in January.  We are both Computer Engineers with only Windows & Linux based x86 platform experience.  I'm on the hardware side, she is a Software Developer.  The purchase is for her use mainly as a programmer (JAVA).  This is our first venture into the Mac world.  Bottom line, this is the best computer I have ever owned (or partly owned).  My work laptop - Dell Latitude D630 looks and feels like a Ford Pinto in comparison.  I have built my home computers for years, but have now converted to MACs.  The hardware is better than most laptops or desktops you can buy locally, so don't let the bloated price scare you.  Compare ergonomics, weight, cosmetics, and then hardware, and I've found Apple products come out on top.  The plan was to purchase this Macbook, then load WinXP Pro for our Window's needs.... she has refused to let Windows on the machine yet.  OSX is fantastic, and the next purchase will be Macbook Pro or iMac where I'll run VM Ware with XP Pro and a dual monitor.  XP Pro will be for required Windows work items, and OSX will be for productivity SW.  I did upgrade the RAM to 4 GB - as it's only eighty bucks.  The machine doesn't have any noticeable bottlenecks, so we haven't moved to a 7200 RPM HDD. For the use this has been put to, it's perfect.  One of our worries was if the white would get dirty - that has not been the case.  If you look at this locally (BestBuy), they tend to be dirty from all the grubby little hands on it daily.  Rubbing Alcohol should clean up anything from the surface.  No complaints.  Everything has worked fantastic.  I recommend iWork as it's a great productivity SW, and you can convert to Window's Office formats if needed.	5.0	4.998229503631592

Love it!!!  Long live Mac!  It easy to use; the software is pragmatic and fun; I hook it up to my printer and e-Mac without any problems.  I'm now using a wireless router for e-mail and internet and it's great.  I'm already preparing presentations for school in the fall.  My only complaint is that some of the software that was  bundled for a free-trial offer has already expired.  I've used both Mac and PC and all I've got to say is, Why would anyone want a PC when they couldf have a Mac?	5.0	5.014441967010498
Fine for about 6 months...  Had gotten a long term job assignment out of state and bought this laptop for use in my hotel room.  I haven't really used it without plugging it in.  I would have to say on average during the week its on about 4-6 hours a day and on the weekends between 6 - 10 hrs a day. I also travel every other weekend and basically it doesnt get used at all... So It worked well.. nothing outstanding but acceptable. At about 6 months after being on for a couple of hours it would just shut down - screen would go black then fan and motor would just  go off.  Id let it cool down then restart and most times it would be fine for awhile.  It began happening more often so I bought one of those dual fan laptop stands to keep it cooler. That seems to help.  At about 13 months ( how convienient for DELL) the thing started shutting down after 15 minutes - fan or no fan.... IM in the process now of trying to find out what the problem is... Did the diagnostics and its states everything is fine....Overall im just dissapointed that after 14 months Im already having issues.... Just real tired of us all becoming a "throw away society" I mean should i spend 250.00 to get the thing fixed or toss it....	2.0	2.3356595039367676
Another Hit from Apple  What great deal this laptop is! Don't try to use advertised prices of windows laptops. The Macs come with so many features as standard equipment they are not really comparable. iphoto, iTunes, iMovie, iDVD, and garage band allows the average person to use and edit their photo's, video's, music they've bought, and music they've made on their own, and the software is easy to use.  i had a Powerbook G4 and the Intel Macbook blows it away. This is a really fast laptop, and it was easy to add software and content from my old computer to my new powerbook with software included on powerbooks. It walks you through the transfer and using firewire makes it very fast.  Unlike my old G4 the powerbook comes with a glossy screen. It's GREAT. The screen is much brighter, and the colors much more vibrant then the older screens. I was worried about reflections, and yes if you put the sun behind you, you'll have a problem. But in every other situation this a great display.  I used to have problems seeing the screen out on the deck, or in a car (no, not driving) but with the glossy screen it is much easier to work out of doors.  Lastly I think that since Apple has vastly increased system bus speeds, and is using faster memory has contributed to dramatic increase in performance.  Windows people should rest assured switching will be a pleaurable experience. And those of you upgrading from power pc Macs can rest assured the change to Intel is a good think.  Oh by the way: we haven't had any problems with noise, this computer runs very quite. It is warm on the bottom as are most laptops. I have seen the video's on YouTube.com about noisey fans, and the ones I've seen are using graphics intensive applications for prolonged periods of time. When you use the processor is used intensively it needs to be cooled. In both situatons I would recommend one of those laptop coolers/shields. Most people with a laptop already have one, some have fans built in, that run off a USB port, and some are passive and work very well. I use the latterf with great success.	5.0	4.996753692626953
thought to represent bad hard drive  First unit was returned; cursor moved erratically; instructions from sender did not rectify; thought to represent bad hard drive.  Second unit loaded pages very slowly.  Ultimately determined  to have a partitioned hard drive which left me with 18 MB of available memory.  Sender sent me instructions which were impossible to carry out.  I finally had to seek help from Apple; they accessed my computer remotely; took 4 hours to rectify problems.  Sender did not properly prepare computer before selling it.  Sender competency in question.	2.0	1.8768872022628784
Terrible Design  Toshiba's A205-S5804 is one of the worst put together laptops I've seen, and as a PC repair technician I've seen quite a few. There are only 2 USB ports on the left side of the machine - which means you need a long USB mouse cord to loop around the back of the machine (for right handed people).  The USB ports are extremely close together and parallel to each other, so any devices you have MUST have an extension cord. Large flash drives, MP3 players, and USB modems will block the 2nd USB port. You must purchase USB extension cords and/or a USB hub. This is extremely frustrating to anyone using Vista's readyboost feature, which allows a flash drive to be used as extra virtual memory.  An Express Card slot allows you to slide a card into the machine, the only problem is that there IS NO Express Card hardware. It is amazingly frustrating to spend 20 minutes trying to line up pins for a device that does not exist.  Preinstalled software includes a gigantic program for controlling Bluetooth (a wireless device like WiFi mostly for printers and phones). This might lead someone to believe that Bluetooth is built into the machine... it isn't. Massive amounts of RAM are devoted to running software controllers for hardware that does not exist.  Also preinstalled are (1) Games you can play only once before having to pay Toshiba to play again (2) Resource hogging anti-virus software that expires in 30 days before demanding hundreds of dollars to keep using it (3) MS Office suite with 30 day expiration  All in all, a badly put together machine. For the same price you can get a refurbished Dell Inspiron with a faster processor, three times the RAM, double the hard drive space, and an integrated 2 mega pixel webcam. HP also makes excellent machines, both refurbished and new. Avoid Toshiba.	1.0	1.0270153284072876

My first Mac in a long time and a very pleasing product  I've been using the Macintosh on and off for about 20 years but left for over 10 years to be a devoted Windows user.  Recent issues with Vista and increasing problems with run-time bloat, incredibly long startup times, malware, and endless updates with their associated mandatory and automatic reboots began to get me thinking about checking out the Mac again.  Particularly with my iPod and iPhone showing me how superior Apple products could be compared to the competition.  So I bit the bullet and purchased my first Macintosh laptop, the new MacBook with glossy screen, dual core Intel processor, and a gig of RAM.  For the most part, the laptop has been a pure joy to use, is built with amazing solidity, and does what it's advertised to do.  However, since I use computers of all kinds all day, I have racked up a number of pros and cons for this mostly stellar new laptop product as I've used this MacBook (in gorgeous matte executive black) the last three weeks on a daily basis.  PROS:  - Amazingly fast boot time, about 20-30 seconds in my tests. Wayyy better than Windows. - Extremely solid construction and feel. - Elegant and compact power cord setup with the famous magnetic detach system to prevent annoying and damaging cord yanks. - Comes with lots of software and apps that really work. - Roomy storage and good overall performance. - Does not run too hot, even when performance settings are turned up. - Supports Bluetooth 2.0 and a lot of the newer, sexier Bluetooth profiles including A2DP and stereo headsets. - Big, bright, clear screen. - The built-in camera takes decent video and it works well with Skype. - With Parallels, runs Windows Vista Ultimate flawlessly so far, even with old apps, simultaneously with the Mac OS. - The feel of the latest Mac desktop seems brawny yet nimble with lots of seductive graphics, morphing windows, flip screens and more.  Makes it a joy visually. - Battery life is acceptable, not finding myself wanting a lot more juice frequently (though occasionally I do.) - Microsoft's Remote Desktop Connection works surprisingly well to control and use Windows PC's remotely, a genuine pleasure since I usually work with 2-4 computers at a time, and I can just Alt-Tab between them from the MacBook.  CONS:  - User interaction often seems weirdly sluggish with a brief, unexplained pause when many common actions are initiated in applications.  Not significantly off putting, but strange for a system with two powerful CPU cores. - WiFi seems slow and inconsistent.  Not a lot of dropped connections, but slower for sure than my PC laptops. - Bluetooth stereo support is crude, with no automatic switching between internal and wireless speakers/mics. - The leading Mac apps (iLife, iWork, Mac Office) just aren't as stable as their Windows counterparts.  Not a lot less stable, but definitely noticeable and sometimes frustrating. - The trackpad and associated button feels heavy and ponderous and is tedious to use for long periods.  Definitely invest in the wireless Mac mouse for serious work, it works well. - Irritating sharp beveled edge on front of the case where your wrists rest.  All edges on the MacBook are smooth except for the one which you rest your wrists.  Careful placement and angling of MacBook can help, but seems inexplicable in terms of good design. - Screen has slightly uneven lighting, not enough to bother but Sony laptops run rings around the MacBook in terms of mind-blowing clarity and lighting consistency. - No extended battery available from Apple (that I know of), not good for serious business users. - No built-in WWAN support, had to buy something from Verizon that hangs off the side, another knock on business use of this product. - 1 GB RAM is not enough for serious daily use, I had to upgrade to 2GB to get things to work right, particularly with Parallels.  For lighter family use, the current MacBook is more than ready for almost any computing task.  For serious business use, the MacBook is just barely there and requires some additional investment (mouse, WWAN, extra battery, Parallels) but that's true of many Windows laptops as well.  One star is subtracted from a perfect score for the strange design shortfalls (average Bluetooth support, sharp edge on the front of the case, so-so trackpad, less than great app stability, less than zippy response of apps.)  I would recommend this product to almost anyone however, the Macintosh has re-arrived on the personal computing scene for sure.  I hope you enjoy it!	4.0	4.971746921539307

HAPPY TO BE WITH APPLE!  Being accustomed to the Windows operating system I had some worries about adjusting to apple.  I couldn't handle Windows anymore--too many crashes, viruses, and so many other problems...I think it was one of the biggest causes of stress in my life!  Switching to apple was a smart move, let me rephrase that...A BRILLIANT MOVE!  The operating system is amazing and makes Windows look horrible...its so easy to use and everything seems so organized.  The software that comes standard with this macbook is excellent!  iPhoto is awesome!! The camera is pretty sweet.  I have enjoyed the glossy screen so far.  As far as overheating, I haven't had any problems...just pick up a notebook cooler to protect it from any heat slow down effects.  I strongly reccomend you purchase extra memory (go for the 1gb upgrade)-you'll be happy you did!  And for the price I think it smart to upgrade to the 120gigabyte hard drive.  After all, if you're looking at paying extra for the sweet black color you probably have some additional cash to fork over for more memory/hard drive.  Here is my little break down list  PROS  - Compact design  - Awesome Screen  - Great interface  - Great basic software package  - I dig the keyboard  - Fast in most applications  -magnetic adapter  -office runs awesome  CONS  -Running non-universal applications can be a bit slower (e.g., creative suite 2) as the program has to be translated through Rosetta-this will not be such a problem as software will become more universal for intel based macs  -it does run hot, but most laptops (in my opinion) do...get a notebook cooler with this purchase  ONCE YOU GO APPLE YOU'LL NEVER LOOK BACK!	5.0	4.861370086669922
A great little linux system  I just purchased one of these units and am extremely satisfied with product.  I would encourage ASUS to make the same item in a sligtly larger size.  The 7" display and keyboard are a bit small.  However, the computer is very, very compact.  It even comes with a rather long AC cord that will surely stretch to any distant airport AC outlet.  The computer comes with the version of the linux operating system.  It includes 'open office' for documents, spreadsheets, and slide presentation.  The computer has three 2.0 USB ports, a built-in webcam, stero speakers, a stero microphone jack, audio jack, and PC video output.  I assume the latter for connection to an over head projector.  There is also a smartcard port for downloading your photos/videos.  The computer also has and RJ45 internet jack and a wireless capability.  In no time was I able to configure the system for my network printer at home and print via the wireless link.  I was also able to plug in my FAT32 Windows external hard disk and read/create file using the linux file manager.  In addition to all this capability, you can access the linux operating system via a 'console' menu item on the file manager.  From this, you run the 'bash' shell (and python shell) and do what most expect from a full blow Unix workstation (wow!).  I have been able to print out manual pages on the bash shell (man -t bash | lpr) and I see not reason I shouldn't be able to write additional bash shell or python scripts.  Under linux, the computer also come with an astronomy program that allows one to control misc. meade telescope, et al..  I believe all I have in this 'mini' computer would have matched Sun's original Unix workstations.  The battery on this unit probably lasts about 3 hours - maybe longer if you turn down the screen brightness.  You can fit the computer in a lady's handbag and have fill wireless internet access as needed while on the go.  This unit is value for dollar and (again) I would encourage ASUS to produce a slightly larger unit that easier on my aging eyes and somewhat fatter fingers.	4.0	4.052053451538086
Consumer Reports Best Buy - August Edition  So who would have thought that this laptop would be listed #3 out of all laptops in this range and a best buy from consumer reports. I bought this laptop doing very little research without knowing how it was ranked and I must say I'm very pleased. I had a IBM T42 prior and this performs better. The wireless connection speed is very good and the glare screen is very bright. I haven't used it much on battery but it seems like that might be one of the only weaknesses. For the $$ you are nuts not to jump on this one.	4.0	4.812727928161621
OK but........  I bought this less than 6 months ago and the screen started to flicker when I would tilt the screen. I sent it to  HP and had it fixed in about 3 days, no charge since it was under warranty. I don't think this is typical but FedEx had a lot to do with it. I've been pretty satisfied with it otherwise. It just seems a little flimsy. I hope it holds up.	3.0	2.7833762168884277
great bargain  I bought this notebook at best buy for a great price at 577.  I do not have complex computer needs as I basically only use it for writing, internet use, music downloads and dvds.  I  would highly recomend this so far.  I have heard terrible things about vista but so far so good as far as I am concerned.  It is fast and performs well in picking up wireless signals.  I was very suprised with the quality of the screen and how colorful and clear it is.  so in conclusion, if you are not looking to spend a lot of money, and you have basic computer needs, I would definetely urge you to look into the sony NR-220e	4.0	4.0413360595703125

Top of da food chain!  I just needed a notebook for wireless web, pics, and tunes, and this Toshiba has more than I need!  The Sony looks better, but you pay for the name and less RAM and slower processor.  The powerbook is an overpriced mac monopoly with less RAM, nuff said.  The only things lacking are bluetooth (get adapter $50) and a graphics chip (that's what PS3 is for baby).  Some complain about battery life, but I use it as a desktop replacement, so that doesn't really concern me.  Toshiba repesentin' to tha fullest son, act like you know.	5.0	4.265558242797852
It Rocks.  Stable, fast and well designed. The iBook is a bit more money than the Windows based laptops, but, Apple stands behind their products with good support.

Excellent at first then many problems later.  Great for a year, then the hard drive crashed and I lost everything -- software, photos, you name it; the letters/characters on the keyboard wore off; I am constantly rebooting computer to make it work right; and I repair it monthly with Tech Tool Pro.  Apple needs to improve the quality of their laptops to match their high prices.	3.0	2.9488422870635986
There are many computers, but this is the one.  Two years later and it's still going strong. This was my first computer on transition from Windows. A great computer! Apple really knows how to make them. The charger has never once broke on me, after numerous times of it getting tugged on. It has actually saved my computer's life. It's held onto the computer magnetically so it easily disconnects if need be. I've dropped this computer a few times myself and other times it has fallen on my sons tantrum. It has survived. Not a scratch or dent. Just don't go throwing it now! After my pleasant experience using this computer, I'm going to be upgrading to a newer model, probably even an iMac. Make sure to keep it on a flat surface. The bottom of it gets very hot after long use.	5.0	3.3633382320404053

You won't be disappointed in the MacBook  I bought this MacBook for my wife to use in law school even though the school required a PC and wouldn't give me any assurance that the MacBook loaded with Windows would be OK. Well turns out its better than OK, Windows XP was no more difficult to install than usual and it works great with her testing software. The added benefit is that she gets to do most of her work in the OS X environment and I don't have to hear her complain about having to use Windows.	5.0	4.504159927368164

Good and simple.  I purchased the dell inspiron 1501 a little over a year ago and was surprised at the reviews. This laptop is perfect for what I use it for: browsing the web and typing papers. I would have given it a 5 star but my lcd and it's hinge was falling off (a year into having this laptop) so I had to get it replaced. At the the time I bought it, I was given a choice of XP and Vista so I opted for XP since I heard many many bad things about Vista. Hopefully when Vista becomes a better OS, I'll upgrade but for now, I think I'll stick with XP.  Overall, it's a good and simple laptop for people that just want something that isn't difficult to use.	4.0	3.9630112648010254

Hard Drive Failed After 14 days.  Bought the computer on my trip to Honolulu Hawaii on Oct. 21. On a business trip to Japan, the hard drive failed and could not get it fixed at Sony Dealers in Japan. Was told that must send to San Diego, CA to get fixed. Recent quotation is $700 plus. Never buy Sony made in China. Will never buy Sony...period.	2.0	1.0421390533447266
White Lightening  My First Mac and its FAST. It boots in less than 24 seconds and i am hopefull it will not vary once i load the data and apps. Its just ready to use in terms of wireless network connectivity. Am still learning how to use the Mac OS-X . Need to load it with Neo/Open Office and uninstall the MS Word Test Drive Suite.  But i am impressed with its performance , especially when playing Video CD or DVD and other CPU intensive graphical apps It has not crashed/hung except once when i trued to make a copy of a Music CD when it was being copied to a burn folder. Underlying OS being Unix like, should make it easier for some users to Tweak and Configure the system. The one thing that Apple can improve is to try to make the surface finish as scratch proof as possible, and the latest version of iLife suite should be provided as a free upgrade.  Also the Software to Burn CD/DVD can be made a little more interactive. I haven't used this feature in my 13" White 1Gig RAM McBook, so please don't take my word for it.	4.0	4.046380996704102

Great value but needs more memory  The computer is exactly as described and works properly.  With 1 gig of memory it is a bit slow and I've ordered memory for it.  I did not realize until after checking out that I could have negotiated with the vendor to upgrade the memory.	4.0	2.808110237121582
Laptop  Held Hostage, September 17, 2012 By Me Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?) This review is from: Apple MacBook Pro MB133LL/A 15.4-inch Laptop (OLD VERSION) (Personal Computers) I ordered a laptop and when it didn't show up on time I called, and was promised upgrades and next day delivery. When my laptop didn't show for a second time I place feedback of one star. I was then called and harassed to remove the feedback or I would not get my laptop. I could not believe they were holding my purchase hostage. if this sods odd, just imagine how i felt. I called a second time, only to be told I would not get my laptop until the feedback was removed. Weird huh? I was so frustrated I finally removed the content only to have my money returned. I would say to NEVER do business with this company ( Mac Palace )	1.0	1.0308313369750977
Recommended but .......  It does NOT come with the restore CD and the driver CD, so if the system need to be reloaded, you simply can't!!  I talked to the Compaq customer service, she said it does not come with one!!  So good luck.  But so far, this is a nice machine, wishing they will make one with a faster HD.	4.0	2.0024116039276123

Be aware and do not pay extra bucks just for name  I had 3 sony laptops , this is(vgn-fz240e) my 3rd laptop. i thought i was unlucky for first 2 computers and i did not blame anyone for this. But if you buy 3 computers and have problems with all of them also have very bad customer service attitude no one can explain this with luck. now i am exactly sure sony is getting worse day by day , they just sale their name Please do not pay extra $200-$300 just for name there are a lot of brands with better products. I will not buy sony again	1.0	1.0457097291946411
Perfect Match  My recent purchase of the Apple iBook Notebook with superdrive is very usier friendly.  I am not a genius when it comes to computers and the iBook was the perfect fit for me.  It was easy to setup and in my opinion an excellant value.	5.0	4.99008846282959
MacBook makes MSBloat look good  After years of pent-up frustration with the bureaucratic, non-intuitive, user-hostile functioning of PCs, Windows, and Microsoft Bloatware, I was really looking forward to my switch over to MacWorld.  I bought a 13.3" Macbook upgraded with the best available processing and memory.  Right out of the box, the thing looked beautiful and sleek.  I switched it on and that's where the fun stopped.  The MacBook and OS Leopard make Microsoft products seem efficient, intuitive, and logical by comparison. I've had mine a month now, and I'm a reasonably intelligent person, so it is fair to say I've given it all the chance an average person should.  I look forward to using it as a $2K aluminum frisbee very soon.  Examples:  I recently spent a 4-hour cross-country flight trying to get the word processor to let me expand the default working window from 5" to a more full=screen adult size.  But you can't do that.  Apparently MacApple also doesn't want you to be able to re-name files, or move them around among folders.  Even deleting them is not a one-key process, you have to drag them here, drag them there, play miniature golf with them, just to get them in the "trash."  But backing up a couple of weeks; right out of the box, most programs started out with some kind of error message.  "Hold on there, you can't do that, who do you think you are"  So I had to burrow dep into the settings and preferences to try to reset things to get Garage Band, iPhoto, iMovie, iTunes etc, to run at the basic level.  And oh by the way, all "Help" menus are online, so you must be connected to the internet to use them.  That's a problem when your problem is that the MacBook won't connect to the internet.  So there went another weekend for me,  wandering through settings and preferences in weirdly arranged menus, trying to set the computer to the most obvious basic settings to get it online.  What sold me on Macs was the reputation that everything about them is "plug and play."  My experience is that almost nothing is.  Now it won't let me send emails while I'm on the road.  And the trackpad is going bad, after 4 weeks of service.  When the CD drive ejects a disc, it sounds like somebody folding a CD jewel case in their hands until it snaps into pieces.  I sense big trouble in there soon.  So: I spent big money experimenting with the switch from PC to Mac.  I used to keep a Bill Gates Voodo doll on my desk, sticking pins in it everytime I ran into some typical PC dysfuncion.  But now Apple has made me a big fan of PCs.  I'll be going back.  The backlit keyboard is nice, and the glossy screen is not the problem other reviewers suggest.  The real problems with this product are not those superficial things.  The real problems are inside.  Run, do not walk, away rom this product.	2.0	3.29518461227417

MAC from PC converter and DELIGHTED !  I had mixed thoughts about buying a IBOOK.  Apple computers have always had a great reputation, but do they live up to expectations?  Are they as good and as compatible as they claim to be?  I bought my IBOOK 14" in Mexico City, but it is the same model as the U.S.A. model.  Technical specifications:  - iBOOK 14"  - 1.42 GHz PowerPC G4 Processor  - 1 Gb of RAM (I added 512Mb)  - 60 Gb Hard Drive  - Super Drive (DVD & CD burner)  - English keyboard  - Bluetooth and Wireless Internet (Airport Extreme) included  - MAC OS TIGER 10.4.2  OPERATING SYSTEM  It's a breeze to use.  You take a bit of time (about 3 days) to get used to it, especially a ONE button mouse and the shortcuts with the keyboard, but it is very nice, very stable.  I've had the computer for a week, no problems in that time.  No freezing, no crashing, but a lot of rebooting for new or updated software.  SPOTLIGHT, and instant finder of files anywhere in your hard drive, DVD/CD bay, IPOD or connected devices is fantastic and easy to use.  On the other hand, the very celebrated DASHBOARD (widgets in your desktop like clocks and maps and calculators) feels and looks very cheap.  Yahoo! Widgets are much better and are available for APPLE and PC computers.  SCREEN  It's bright, bright, bright !  Looking at it from different angles does not give you a very sharp and contrasted image, but right in front of you, it has incredible colors.  TIGER OS, also has incredible and elegant wallpapers and icons that are a joy to see through your screen.  14" is good enough for me.  If you read something about "fuzzy text" in other reviews, it is true; compared to my previous laptop (Sony VAIO 15" monitor) it is fuzzy, but it isn't too much and won't notice it in a couple of days.  Best of all, the screen came with no dead pixels.  Excellent quality.  KEYBOARD  It has a very nice feel to it.  It is soft but yet sturdy.  I have it configured in Spanish and can type the characters "" and the accents "'" easily, no need for silly "apple+n+n" combinations or "apple+e+vocal".  Underneath the keyboard you will find the extra space for an additional RAM memory module.  HARD DISK  Announced as a 60Gb disk, it really has a 55.5Gb capacity minus the pre-installed TIGER OS, which leaves around 42 - 43 Gb of free space.  FORTUNATELY, I have seen that Apple software (Office, Adobe, Macromedia, etc) are made in VERY small files (Office 2004 is only around 250Mb big), so you will have PLENTY of space (30 - 35 Gb) free when you have done installing quite a lot of programs.  Games, on the other hand, do take a lot of space.  RAM MEMORY  I heard that 512Mb were enough, but several people got me convinced on getting an additional 512 which cost $170 USD here in Mexico.  It does better performance and allows multitasking (I use Excel, Fire Instant Messenger, Safari Web-browser, Itunes and posibly Adoble at the same time with no lag).  The instalation of the RAM can be do-it-yourself and it is easy (I was very frightened at first, but found it easy enough).  The computer recognized the new RAM memory right away.  CD/DVD  I have been able to read copied DVDs in this driver which I haven't been able to play elsewhere (I'm sorry, it was a present, but say NO to piracy).  I have only burned data disks so far, but with TOAST 6.0 Software (not included out of the box) it was a breeze and the burn rate was very fast (around 600Mb in 4 min).  DVDs look OK, but they lack a LOT of crispiness and contrast.  CDs sound great !  SPEAKERS  They are small, have no bass, but sound good overall.  AIRPORT EXTREME  Thank goodness this is standard now.  I picked up wireless hotspots easily and manage to connect in a few seconds.  I have not found it to be as powerful as some people say.  It still can't get a decent signal through to concrete walls, but one wall  gets you a nice signal.  BLUETOOTH  This thing is awesome, if you have a cel phone with camera and bluetooth connectivity, you certainly want to check this out !  It connects easily and fast.  I had my strange format videos from my phone in the my hard drive in no time and playing in Quicktime (format .gp3, who knew?)  BATTERY  Just as promised.  If you use non-demanding software and no CD drive, you will have around 4.5 - 5.5 hours of battery, which is GREAT.  They other day I installed software using the CD drive and had it in "maximum performance" and still the battery lasted for about 3 hours.  The option of adjusting the energy consumption through processor performance is great, so you can set it to "low consumption" if you are doing internet only or "high performance" if you are doing heavier stuff.  Also dimming your screen brightness and deactivating Bluetooth and Airport Extreme will result in longer battery life.  PROCESS0R  It's not lightning speed, it seems quite as fast as my old Celeron 2.4GHz (aprox. Pentium IV 1.7 Ghz), but it does the job.  VIDEO MEMORY  I have seen no problems with this.  Although I do not do image rendering or design, my Astronomical software has had no problems with this.  CASE  It is a beautiful case, the white is astonoshing and the lit up Apple behind the screen is just way too cool.  Yet, NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, it will sooner or later get scratched.  It is up to you how much you take care of it and how deep and common will your scratches be.  OVERALL:  I have used the computer for too little, only one week, yet I believe that going back to Windows is a big NO NO.  This system rocks, it's easy to use and stable.  The goodies offered are great and at a fantastic value.  The battery life is awesome, yet the disk space could be bigger.  2 USB ports, 1 FireWire 400, 1 DVI video (strange format) seem to be enough considering that you have bluetooth for new-generation mouses, printers and extra keyboards.  Office's Excel in spanish has proved to be quite annoying.  The decimal point separator is a "," instead of a "."  This is the way Spain uses it, but not the rest of LatinAmerica and there is NO WAY OF CHANGING THIS PREFERENCE.  Tiger Operating System has proved to be compatible with (almost) everything, why not switch now when the price and the hardware are correct?	5.0	5.008077621459961
Looks awesome, sounds awesome, but crippled by awful design.  I've had this machine since early 2010 - and to start things off it was EXTREMELY over-priced for the specs it has. An Asus or Lenovo of the same, or greater quality would be nearly half the price. You're only paying for the "wow" affect this computer leaves people with.  Once I took this thing out of the box, I had issues within a week. It was overheating CONSTANTLY. I contacted Alienware and got 0 support, and after much research I found this was an issue with the entire line of M15x machines and that I was screwed - the only way to cut down on the overheating was to air dust it every few weeks or so, which was VERY annoying to do, and yet the problem still persisted.  The computer also had many bugs that came along with the pre-installed OS, and the DC Port has crapped out on me twice. You only have 2 USB Ports, no HDMI support, its heavy and bulky. Its very glossy, so it scratches easily and the paint chips at ease, and the display is honestly very sub-par for a computer of it's price. It will also sound like an obnoxious washing machine whenever its running - louder than most bulky desktops.  The only good thing about this machine was its awesome speed, smooth keyboard, and flashy looks. Playing around with your backlights and other appearance settings in the command center always gets you a nice reaction from others, and just looks simply awesome.	2.0	2.032647132873535

Quit working  I was very pleased with this computer when it arrived. It came within just a few days and I had reason to contact the seller prior to shipment and he responded quickly. However, the screen went black after about 60 days. It appeared that the computer itself was working because you could see the lights blinking but nothing on the screen. I contacted the seller asking if there was anything he might be willing to do but I've not received a reply and that was over 2 months ago. This is very disappointing after spending the money for this item and not being able to use it at all. Being retired and on a fixed income means we need to watch our purchases - we think this item should have lasted longer than a couple of months.	2.0	1.1421396732330322
was great about letting me return it for a full refund  The computer kept shutting off, the keyboard skipped. Many programs would not work on it because it was unable to be updated.

I also sent a message relative to such anomaly, and I have not even gotten a reply.  Today is September 27th some two months later. I went and bought a power cord for the item, and to my surprise the item doesnt even work. Amazon, look what dishonesty you've orchestrated against me!

Computer was not capable of being internet and media ready  We bought this for our daughter who's going to college this summer. It was to have all the bells and whistles so nothing was needed... She opened on christmas morning and couldn't connet to the internet, couldn't listen to music and couldn't watch a dvd. We will now have to pay just as much to get it up to speed as it was to buy the computer in the first place. Very sad considering it took all we had to get this for her!

BUYER BEWARE! DESIGN DEFECT!  I purchased a HP Pavilion TX1000. Within 12.5 months the laptop completely failed. The symptoms are as follows: (1) the wireless adapter fails and is undetectable; (2) the video fails; and (3) the computer does not boot anymore.  I purchased a new wireless adapter to install. It did not work. I plugged an external monitor to the video card, but it did not show an image.  HP knows that their is a design defect with this laptop, specifically the nVidia chipset that they use. The laptop overheats and destroys the motherboard.  DO NOT BUY HP! They have refused to acknowledge its design defect and have refused to help any of the costumers who have wasted upwards of $1200.00 USD from purchasers! In fact, I have written to the CEO's office twice and to no avail, they have refused to help me. They claim that their research group has not identified the TX1000 as a problem and refuse to recall the product or investigate out problems! They are liars, cheats and crooks!	1.0	1.0189104080200195
A compilation of all reviews  After reading all of the reviews I have come to the following conclusions.  1: Apple's operating system is light years ahead of Windows    XP or Linux.  2: You will need to purchase the extra 256 megs of RAM and the    60 gig HD.  3: Unless you want to really screw up your computer, forget    trying to outsmart the engineers at Apple and buy Apple    products or approved Apple products.  4: You will never have a virus. It's impossible to get one!    The nature of the operating system makes receiving a virus    impossible.  5: The system will almost never crash and is easier and more    pleasant to use than any other.  6: Everything works seamlessly.  7: For this convenience and superiority you will pay more up    front for everything and less on the back end. Quality costs.  8: Ben Franklin said that he always bought the best and most    expensive item. It is always cheaper in the long run.	4.0	4.0721001625061035

(Almost) Perfect!  Pros:  Slick look  Intuitive OS  Simple to use  Awesome features  Nice software package  Just plain cool  Cons:  The edges are a bit on the sharp side, and can leave your wrist sore when typing  Sensitive to scratches and fingerprints  Glare  I got the Macbook about a month ago, was impressed by the glossy look and simple layout. I upgraded the memory myself when it arrived, which costs less than buying it built-in and is still covered by the warranty. The Macbook was blazingly fast and it ate everything I threw at it. Having read that it wasn't the best computer to play graphics-intensive games, I downloaded a Halo demo off apple's site. Not one problem gaming-wise. It did eat up my battery and put the fans to work, but that was expected. Under normal conditions (most itunes work, web-surfing and word-processing) the battery life was healthy and the computer was whisper-quiet. I had also heard that older Macbook models had heat issues, but mine has had none whatsoever.  The OS was simple for me to get the hang of, considering I was a life-long Windows user, and the features come in handy. I use Expose all the time, it eliminated all my window clutter. Dashboard has tons of nice apps you can download (I recommend istat, which is kind of like the Windows Task Manager, letting you know everything from uptime to temps).The bundled software that comes with the Macbook is actually useful, not like the apps that come with PCs, which seem randomly thrown in just for fattening effect.  Now for the problematic stuff. First and foremost, the scratches. I took reasonable care of my Macbook, yet it was scratched within 2 weeks of my getting it. The scratches weren't deep, but they were cosmetically bothersome. If you're planning on buying one, and you care about the glossy finish, you better buy a case for it. Second, the edges of the keyboard are rather sharp, and can irritate your wrists when you're typing. The case solved this problem, but it is worth noting anyways. Also, if you configure the trackpad for tap-clicking, it is a bit sensitive, I have had to put the cursor back in place a couple of times when typing. Finally, glare has been  nagging me, I had to lower the screen brightness and tilt it back to make it go away (I still wonder why Apple didn't make Macbooks with a matte screen)  Overall, this were only minor annoyances for me, and were more than compensated by the nice features of the Macbook (and by my sister's green face when she saw it =P).	4.0	4.140756607055664

Weigh your needs  After hearing so much about Mac's reliability I took the plunge with the MBA.  It is a beautiful piece of equipment with moderate power. I would recommend getting the Superdrive since the remote access does not play well with Windows machines. The wireless did link well with wireless internet at variable speed, but I could not help to notice that one of the first updates it downloaded was for the remote access.  The hard drive comes with 95Gig of available space due to the pre-installed Apple software. You can custom install a  smaller version of the OS with a gain of seven Gig (remove languages, printer drivers and Alex's voice, etc.). It starts up and shuts down quickly. Battery life is not five hours, but expect at least three hours of use per charge.  If you use Windows, there are far faster laptops as a much lower price  that exceed the processing speed of this system...but they ain't as light, pretty, and do not run Mac.	3.0	3.6759257316589355
Good laptop but poor quality.  I have this notebook for little more than a month, but it went back to Apple two time already. First time is the delete key fall out, and now the hard drive is disappeared in the system, meaning the system can't locate the hard drive, and can't start up. Apple said will replace the hard drive for me, but this should not be the case for a 47 days laptop.	3.0	2.9910402297973633
Defective motherboards  The HP PC's are TRASH in my opinion. I bought the DV6226US in March 2007, and my System Board fried just 7-1/2 months later. They replaced it, and 8 months later if fried again - and HP wouldn't cover it. With the excessive heat no wonder! A system board crashing is rare but 2 boards in 16 months is nothing but defective product - pure and simple. DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT	1.0	1.0197842121124268

Disappointing support. Slow boots.  Purchased based on Sony's reputation.  15-20 Gb of the 120 Gb hard drive is lost to recovery software.  I thought that I was getting XP Professional and got XP Media Center which provides a lot of cluttering software that is of no value to me.  Sony makes this software perilous to remove.  I was unable to access the 60-day trial Office package. Booting sometimes takes 90 seconds.  I had a partial system crash caused, I think, by installing a virus update that required a re-boot.  Sony's only help was to do a complete recovery, which requires reinstalling all software and databases - a task I may not be up to.  My son fixed all of the problems but two.  Sony's Vaio Support Central shows up in the Change or Delete software list, but cannot be accessed from the Start menu or anywhere else that I know of.  I can no longer get my Canon Selphy CP-510 printer to function on this computer (it works on another PC and a Mac)and neither Sony nor Canon have been able to solve the problem.  My first new computer in over 4 years and it already seems to be getting old.	3.0	2.0174028873443604

didn't work  I ordered a 2G surf to take with me while traveling.  I was so excited about getting a small, lightweight, easy to carry little computer!  The package got here, I opened it and set it up right away and then when I turned it on and the screen for the license agreement came up, I couldn't do anything - the touchpad wouldn't work at all.  I tried restarting, I called the ASUS support number, they had me press the reset button and start it up, press F9 to get back to the factory install settings, etc.  But nothing worked. A couple times when trying to type 'yes' to reboot - the keyboard wouldn't work either.  I need it soon for a trip - they wanted me to send it back to them to CA with one day shipping and then they said they would send me another one.  I checked and it would have cost me $89 to send it there with 1 day shipping.  I bought it through a 3rd party here for $249.  I could drive down the street and buy one for $299 from Target and it would cost less than sending this one back.  I called the shop from Amazon that I ordered it from and said I wanted to return it.  They said they will pick it up tomorrow.  Now I am really sad!  I was really looking forward to using this little guy!  Now I don't know if I want to take a chance with another one of these or not or find another brand of mini-notebook.  On the plus side - it started up quickly, as far as the startup went anyway.  And I don't think the size of the keyboard would have bothered me.  I wanted small and sturdy and cheap - just to travel with now and then.  I didn't expect it to function like  a full laptop, but I expected it to at least work.	1.0	1.0198689699172974
Great budget notebook  I just recently purchased this notebook and am very pleased with it thus far. First thing I did was remove Microsoft Works and installed Office 2003, along with removing Norton anti-virus and installing McAfee in its place. The computer handled the removal and installs very well. At home I use a wireless router to connect to the internet.  The built-in wireless works well, but the connection quality was weaker than both my PDA (Ipaq) and my roommate's Compaq Presario from the same distance from the router.  The battery life was about 2.5 hours with the wireless internet connected while ripping a few CDs. For $829.00 I find this to be an exceptional value compared to other laptops this size and weight and would recommend it to anyone looking for a budget laptop with nice features.	5.0	5.022627830505371

excellent product - just what I needed  This is my first laptop and first Mac after using a desktop for so long.  There was no setup time, it recognized my wireless network right away, and is so easy to use.  Plus it looks great!  It has just enough bells and whistle, although I primarily use e-mail and internet anyway.  Highly recommended!	5.0	4.9956374168396
Laptops ordered  I ordered 6 laptops form this company and it took 30 days to get my order after it got lost in the mail. another shipment was sent out. I received them Friday the 5yh of July. The package was all ripped up and how they were packed was really bad. As I checked the laptops out I found out that only one of them worked 4 of them had to have the battery replaced to be able to keep time and date correct. I knew the laptop batteries were not going to work but not to expect that I would have to replace the other battery's also. One of them would not work at all. I had to spend extra money sending all of these to a computer tec to fix the issues with them. The one that did not work has to have the motherboard replaced. I did not spend the money on these computers to get junk. I knew there would be problems like dents and scratched but I did expect working computers. I am out an extra $100.00 on these getting repairs and have wasted the money on one of them because it will cost more than I paid on the laptop to replace the mother board.	1.0	1.0213714838027954
Dont be dumb  Doesnt work after about a month of having it, runs really slow, no updates are available for the product anymore, and cant run absolutely anything on it.

Windows Users - BEWARE!!  Writing this review on my old laptop with windows. Very unhappy with new macbook. Windows don't cover the whole screen making my 13 inch essentially a 10 inch. Very confusing and hard to navigate. Never tried Vista but lifetime windows user and I feel like I just walked into Starbucks for the 1st time and don't know the silly names they give their sizes. Can't "double tap" the touch pad - have to click on the button, so using one hand to navigate is not possible. Going to give it a shot over next couple of days before exchanging it for a windows based laptop.	1.0	1.035186529159546
WONDERFUL, BEAUTIFUL,  and all around PERFECT!!!!!  This is my first mac product, and I LOVE it!!!!  It is even better than I expected!!!  It is so fast, powerful, sleek, thin, light, beautiful and MUCH more!!  I can run Windows and Mac on here at once, and it still runs really fast.  Because of Mac's great design and features I found out that most people don't even need to run Windows on their macs.  it makes everything from Graphic design to just regular, check your email use.  I absolutely ADORE my mac!!  HIGHLY recommended for every one!!!	5.0	4.994373798370361
Decent and stylish but not very hardy!  I got my vaio about a year back to replace an aging desktop. In about 6 months, a couple of keys came off but sony support replaced those immediately.  I'e had some problems wiht the operating system- for instance, internet explorer will not show some images on websites. Its irritating (is it SP2? I don't know). ALso, the beautiful case gets scratched easily adn the screen seems very delicate- I don't carry it around too much and I am afraid to.  But otherwise it is a great little machine which I can take around and use anywhere in the house. Very pretty, very smart only thing is needs more strength.	3.0	2.990064859390259
Avoid Sony at all cost!  Absolutely terrible product - bought a FZ 190e notebook in 2007. From day one the battery was problematic. Sent in for service and it came back with a note "works to spec for specified user mode" - translation the battery lasts 1.5 hours in normal mode. This is a brick that needs a AC adapter all the time. Also the mouse on the computer is horrible - have a Thinkpad from work and the mouse is 100x better. The only thing worse then the product is their customer service. My battery died at 14 months - guess what: the $400 warranty that I got stiffed for from Sony does not cover it. The single most defective part of their computer is not covered. BTW if you login into their site they don't have any history of purchases. So in summation: product sucks, sony website sucks, warranty sucks - I think that pretty much covers all the bases they could possibly mess up.	1.0	1.0316152572631836

Great machine, horrible support  Any 4810T made before July has a problem due to thermal instability. When driven hard for a while the machine becomes slower and slower and just stops, showing 100% CPU activity, even with no user activity at all. This is caused by faulty peripheral drivers that cause the CPU to spend all of its time in interrupt service routines. The problem can be cured by downloading and installing the latest BIOS, driver, and application files from Acer's web site. However, if my experience is any guide, you will not find this out by talking to Acer's facetiously named Customer Care Representatives. I bought a 4810T-8480 from Staples on July 27, 2009, and received a unit that was manufactured on May 8, 2009. Needless to say, the unit had "sleeping sickness". Before I researched this problem on the internet I called Acer's customer-no-service twice, each time giving a detailed explanation of how the machine slowed down and stopped with 100% CPU but no activity: The first time I was advised to clear the internet state (a total non-sequitur, since when the phenomenon occurs one cannot do anything). The second time I was directed to clear out Windows/Temp and /Tasks, another time-waster. It seems impossible that these people have not heard of this problem, so why are they misdirecting customers from the solution? A conscientious company would be pro-actively notifying customers with these machines and providing them fixes. Anyway, I solved the problem by downloading and installing EVERY driver and application update offered for my machine on Acer's site [...] and especially by flashing the latest BIOS, which as of this writing is ver. 1.23. Acer attempts to discourage BIOS upgrades, and includes a dire warning in red at the top of the BIOS downloads which reads in part: "...Acer recommends that you should only update your firmware/drivers if you have been instructed to do so by an Acer Customer Care Representative." However, since it is clear that Acer has only Customer Don't-Care Representatives, that isn't going to happen, so ignore that warning and forge ahead. After downloading and running the upgrade you may have one brief heart-stopping moment when a pop-up appears that says that the installation may have failed and seems to ask for your input. TOUCH NOTHING and the BIOS flash will end with an automatic reboot. Be sure to select the correct OS in the not-so-obvious pull-down box when selecting drivers and applications to download and install. In general, it won't hurt to attempt to install the wrong driver, since the install will either fail or just leave a useless driver, but of course you needn't download drivers for peripherals that you don't have, such as in my case Bluetooth. The one exception to that that I found was in selecting the web camera application: There are two, one from Chicony and one from Suyin, and no obvious way to tell which vendor's camera is installed in my machine. I guessed and installed Suyin first; it didn't work, so I installed the Chicony application over it, which did work. It might have been better practice to have removed the first application before installing the second. I hope that this helps anyone who buys a down-level Timeline - Lord knows you won't get any help from Acer! Once the updates are installed, this is a very nice machine. The battery lifetime, if not quite the advertised 8 hours, is still impressive. It is cool enough to actually use on a lap. No, the slow-down is not inherent in the speed of the processor, which is perfectly adequate for most uses. It will never satisfy a gamer, but that is obviously not its niche. It's a great machine for a student to carry around all day, running Office aps, accessing the web, etc. If it weren't such a do-it-your-self project I would have rated it higher. If you see any Acer reps or especially Acer execs, give 'em Hell for me!	3.0	1.8738433122634888

This laptop has 1GB RAM!  The previous reviewer was either misguided about the amount of RAM in his or her notebook, or was writing about an older version of the laptop. The present laptop has 1GB of RAM, which is quite adequate for Vista Home Premium (included with this laptop). I have just purchased it for $479 from Staples. I found it running Vista just fine. If you are new to Vista, there is some adjusting to do, because quite a bit of the interfaces have changed. If you install Linux then this laptop is very good value for its price.  There are however some weaknesses: (1) Battery life is short. For me, it has been about 1.5 to 2 hours. There are two reasons for this: (a) this laptop only has a 6-cell battery, and surprisingly Compaq does not even have a 9-cell battery upgrade for this model; (b) secondly, this laptop uses the (relatively) more power hungry Athlon X2 processor, usually used in desktop computers. You will find that other notebooks that use AMD's Turion processors will give you better battery life, perhaps 1.5 times of what Athlon will give you.  The second weakness is what I consider a design flaw -- the touchpad is located right at the center. It is a problem because when I position my index fingers at "F" and "J", my right palm will be touching the touchpad and subsequently will inadvertently drag the cursor around while I am typing. I will try to look for a way to make the touchpad less sensitive to my "palm-click" and report here if I find one.	4.0	3.865382671356201
No Service  This may be a good product. I don't know,because it came to me inopt & the seller refused to make it right. After several months pleading about service, lying & refusing to help, I finally gave up! Took an INOPT laptop(sold refurbished,in good shape)& put it in the shop. Sold by costomstechnology,the worst people to do business with. I would just like to know how this can be legal & how places like this can stay in business. Furthermore, look for reviews with BBB.

My First Laptop and it's a beauty!  This Macbook works great. I'm a musician and using it for recording and playing live. Right out of the box it works perfect. I added ram to 2 gb  and it works a little faster than 1gb.  The best is hooking this up to my 56" proj. TV and launching photobooth  when family and friends visit- they bust out laughing using the "carnival  like" morph filter that distorts faces in funny ways.  Its a challenge to make PC's work as well. It reminds me of way back before  computers when you can flip on the TV, grab the remote and enjoy without  opening it up and replacing components. Only now- my life is on 24/7.	5.0	4.983400821685791
Apple MacBook Pro  Lack of written material makes it difficult for users who are accustomed to Windows to start off.  The Boot Camp Assistant that is supposed to be able to install and run Windows has obvious flaws that users - and some Apple resellers - haven't so far been able to solve. The notebook itself is well designed and well made, with excellent graphics.	4.0	3.6267173290252686
Excellent Notebook / Great Value  I've had this Macbook for several weeks now.  As soon as they updated the low end model with a Core 2 Duo cpu and 1 GB of Ram I couldn't resist to replace my 1gz G4 iBook any longer.  I can understand why x-windows start raving about the OS but I'm not going to go in to how great Mac OSX is.  The Good: Quality, it's fast, good looking and I LOVE the glossy display. I know 13.3 inches doesn't sound like much but remember it's widescreen and I prefer this over the regular 15" screens. I like the new keyboard. Also, the wireless reception is so much better than with my old iBook. MAC OSX & of course iLife.  The Bad: Battery doesn't seem to last as long as iBook. It does get hot!- not a deal breaker though.  The Ugly: Integrated graphics. -I know you got to save money somewhere but there was a time when Apple Inc would pride themselves in not using integrated graphics. It's really a non-issue for the majority(90%) of users. But this Macbook will never be a serious gaming or professional video editing machine.  The Macbook is a great deal, perfect for students and teachers.	5.0	4.987824440002441

Don't buy into the HP hype...Dell PCs are still better  Buy a Dell.  Hp is good, but if you play 3D games, edit video/images, or run large programs, the Dell Inspiron is the way to go.  I own the dv6707us and there are no problems, but there's not too much to boast about either.  It's a plain pc with some asthetic features.  Don't get me wrong, I recommend this PC to simple internet and Email users, but if that is all you do, the dv6707us is too expensive.  Your best option is to configure your own PC based upon your personal needs.  That way, you can guarantee yourself that you will not be disappointed.  If you don't know what parts to include, ask someone who does.  Also, it is a good idea to own a desktop computer and not just a laptop.  Desktop PCs are easy to upgrade and are very reliable.	3.0	3.0210888385772705

Good mobile desktop - one of the best in this price range  This is a very good machine for users looking for a mobile desktop.  It has all the key features for a mobile desktop: powerful Intel CPU, DVD, CD-RW, 15" screen, plenty of RAM and HDD space. The CPU was built by Intel to be used in desktops, not notebooks; that mean it uses more power and runs a little hotter. Toshiba has been using desktop CPU in their low cost machines because they cost less.  If (like many users) you tend to plug your notebook in and use it at a desk, then this is a pretty good deal.  If you are looking for a thin, light, long life notebook that will sit on your lap for long periods, then this isn't the machine for you (those machines are much higher up the price ladder). The graphics on this notebook are okay, but they won't run newer 3D games very well.  They are great for moderate gaming, CAD work, or watching DVDs.  In all fairness there are very few notebooks in this price range that have 3D gaming quality graphics.  The HP  xt125 is an exception to this rule if you really want a gaming capable notebook (it has it's own tradeoffs like a 14" screen).  If you "want it all" you will have to spend a bit more money. This is a low cost notebook so you don't quite get everything.  The quality of the components is good, but not first rate, the battery life isn't a long as more expensive offerings, and this isn't a notebook built for hardcore gamers.  But if you want a powerful computer you can carry around with a large screen, then you won't find many that compare in this price range.	4.0	4.370193004608154
Customer Support  Disappointed in the customer support I received on this purchase.  I believe that an option to upgrade Windows 7 Starter to Home Premium or higher should have been offered at time of purchase.  Thw Win 7 Starter does not even allow you to add a personal screen saver.  I have talked with a Rep from DataVision but communication went silent when I asked them to pay for the return shipping expense.  The other features of the computer are great.  Too bad we could not come to an agreement on a software change.	2.0	1.9958903789520264
NOT WORTH THE MONEY!  I have had a stream of problems with this thing since day one. The power cord stopped working less than 4 months after we bought it. So I used the back up and it too stopped working a month or so later. Bought a new one and it stopped working after about 5 months. Went online and saw that that was an extremely common problem.  The processing speed is sooooo slow. Everyone around me using pc's is connecting to the internet at lightening speeds compared to my mac and yet mac cannot figure out why. I took it into a mac shop and they couldn't figure out why it was running so slow. Everything from opening a simple word document to surfing the internet is slow. Again, went online and it too is a common problem. They have a list of "fixes" for the problem that you can do yourself but not one of them worked.  The pros are it boots up in seconds compared with the lifetime it takes a pc BUT what difference does it make that it's up if it won't run. Another pro is it is very light compared to the standard laptop pc.  BOTTOM LINE: For pretty much twice what you can pay for a pc laptop this thing should be PERFECT! and it is not. It's absolutely no better than a standard slow moving pc.	2.0	1.9931024312973022

HP L2000 Special Edition notebook  First time notebook owner. Partner, who is an IT admin, also thinks its a nice notebook, and is now shopping for one as a result of this purchase. :)  Brightscreen and display very nice. Snappy processer, battery life around 3 hours with internet and some video downloads with 6 cell standard battery. Plays Neverwinter Nights at max graphics game settings. However if you want a notebook that can play Doom 3 you may need to look elsewhere. Very easy to carry notebook around, lightweight and study case. Heat is an irritant; the fan/cpu are on the left hand side, and it can warm up your lap quite fast. Am looking at purchasing a cooling blanket to assist both lap and laptop. :). I can see that if hearing fan noise is irritating, it could be an issue.  Will also be upgrading the ram from 2 x 256 the notebook came with-however that is enough for what I use the notebook for. ( Surfing the net, dvd's, writing, emails, some light game playing ). Considering the Amazon price rebate AND the 100 mail in rebate, a great notebook. Chose the AMD 64 for " futureproofing " also with Windows Longhorn out next year. Already have a carry case so did not get the Targus.  Our pug managed to knock the laptop off a shelf on the 1st day of ownership and there's not a mark or dent, and the notebook's carried on fine since. Lance Armstrong badging quite tasteful.  Overall, would recommend this laptop with a gentle warning about the heat if using overlong on the lap or in bed.	4.0	3.9650444984436035
True Love At Last  This little beauty came into my life around Christmas, and she and I have been inseparable since then.  I ordered it directly from the Apple Store Online, and I had it maxed out on RAM, and had the optional 60G hard drive installed.  I love the processor speed, immense capability, and versatility.  The screen size makes it a suitable replacement for a desktop computer. I do everything on this computer: word-processing, spreadsheets, music transcription, photo editing, Internet communications, audio editing, and managing my music collection.  I have Office X, Sibelius, and  iLife 2004. I run iTunes in the background, write a report integrating Excel and Word, plus can have all my pictures handy on iPhoto.  I can have five or six applications running at the same time (not including iChat and MSN Messenger, which are ALWAYS running), and the processor doesn't even hiccup.  I use an iPod 40G as an external hard drive (not to mention all dem kewl tunes!), and have a Canon PowerShot A80 digital camera, and an iMic audio converter.  Add to that an AirPort driven wireless network and a laser printer, and you have an ultra-powerful home office for any kind of occupation, from music composition, culinary research, to communications-based businesses. Although larger and heavier than the 12" iBook, I believe the 14" screen is definitely worth the extra weight and price.  If you get it, the wireless card (AirPort Extreme) is a must.  The optional built-in Bluetooth module is nice, especially if you have a compatible PDA or cell phone. I didn't realize I would love owning a laptop.  Until I met this one.	5.0	5.015020370483398
Excellent Notebook...  I researched for 6 months before choosing this IBM.  Great value, solid notebook.  Love the keyboard and the access IBM help.  I have called tech support for information and help with software installations and driver updates and they were very good and patient with all my detailed questions.  This is important to me... to have good tech support available. This T41 comes with a 3 year warranty.  IBM's website has excellent support.  I love the automated stuff where it analyzes your computer and tells you what updates you need.  Sometimes their driver upgrades are more for the IT person. But, just download their software installer and it works great.  However, you must focus...if you want to understand what you have downloaded.  Not totally for the novice. Tech support walked me thru it once and I was on my way.  So far so good after only a month, the T41 rocks!  Particularly the higher-end graphics card, glad I went for that.  I can tell the difference when comparing with my desktop LCD.  The CD burner works well and I use Nero 6.  I had been using a 4x burner on my desktop and this one writes at 24x...what a difference.  If you are contemplating a notebook, consider this one.  Pay the extra bucks and go with IBM...very glad I did!	5.0	4.9994635581970215

Old, Yet new Device  My Godmother gave this Lenovo T-61 to me back in 2007. As I already owned an IBM ThinkPad R-31 model, the T-61 sat boxed in my living room for over six years. But in January 2014 the motherboard of the R-31 died on me and I had no choice but to unbox the T-61 for use.  I got it set up in April 2014 and with Webroot as my antivirus protection things seemed to be fine. Unfortunately Windows XP is no longer supported and despite having a "new" computer, my operating system is obsolete. I've been having problems logging onto the Internet Explorer which is a Micro Soft company. I'm frustrated. As a result of this I'm going to have to purchase Windows 7.0, a system I'm unfamiliar with. To make matters worse, the word is they will change to Windows 8.1 in the near future. how long will Windows 7.0 be supported!  I give the T-61 unit Three Stars. It will never compare to my R-31 of old.  A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr.	3.0	2.790836811065674

Awesome Laptop but gets too hot!!!  This is my first laptop so I don't have a comparison point. I didn't have a laptop before because I thought they weight too much and I knew I would be carrying them around... I bought it because is small and it has everything included (bluetooth, webcam, dvd writer with ligthscribe, etc) so the size is a big factor for me.  Also the price is just right.  It is a deal for what you get. Pluses: The webcam is amazing.  My family said that the image looks like TV. The sound is very good it gets really loud.  It comes with remote control for the media part.  And it looks very good.  The screen is just beautiful. Top of the line  Cons:  It gets way too hot.  I have had the laptop on for less than 10 minutes and I can't stand it anymore in my lap.  I don't know about the other laptops but for me the idea was to go to coffee shops or livingroom and have it on my lap.  I use one of those laptop tables and it's not enough after half an hour.  I plan to look for a solution or I will have to return it.  I can't use it as a laptop if it is too hot.  If I have to put it on a table I rather use my desktop!!! The mouse pad has incorporated a wheel that you can NOT deactivate. You need to deactivate the whole mouse and wheel which is very inconvenient. Conclusion: Excellent features, prices and aesthetics but awful usability.  TIP: If you buy the laptop the first thing you must do is delete the HP software (that is suppose to help you).  It crashes the vista, it didn't detect my wireless network, we spent 2 hours trying to figure it out. When we delete it, everything worked and I could "put it my lap" ;-)	1.0	2.942404270172119
This Mini Netbook Laptop is a cheap toy!  I bought one of these, got it in the mail yesterday, and didn't expect much for the low price that I paid, but at least I had hoped it would power up and last longer than 3 hours. I got it turned on, got it to connect to my home network for about 20 minutes, got disconnect and could not get it to reconnect to my home networking system even after sitting right in front of the router. The touch pad caused the cursor to erratically jump all over the display so had to connect a mouse to one of the USB ports. About 3 hours into trying everything to connect to my network I heard a faint "pop", the display went blank, I could smell that electrical overheating odor, and the back of the display lid began to feel warm. I depowered it and emailed the seller. Even though I paid for an additional 1 year warranty I now find out that the warranty is with a 3rd party, not with the company that I purchased it from. If I return it for a refund (at this time I have not received a return authorization) I will be charged a 25% "restocking fee" plus pay the return postage. I'll just have to take my losses but at least have learned a lesson... buy a name brand from a reputable company. You get what you pay for.	2.0	1.035701036453247
Great Computer  This computer is very good value, it does come with some bloatware but so did my D*ll. Unlike my other machine it does handle Win Vista quite well.  My only cons for this system are:  1) The graphics card only gets a 3.0 in Win performance rating while my other system gets 3.1 on the Intel standard stuff.  2) The D-sub connection does not have the retaining screws so it fits quite loose.  3) The speakers sound great but they are not loud, not something you expect on an entertainment system.  I have used this system to play DVDs and it is excellent. The wireless works perfectly and has good range, the battery life compares to all other systems in this class, wish it had a time meter however. I have not tried the light scribe but the burner is excellent. For me the best things about this system are it is light and the screen is beautiful.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great system at good value with high portability you just can't go wrong. With Amazon free shipping it was just 2 days away.	4.0	4.025918483734131
I really want to love it...  I really want to love my 13" Macbook Pro.  I really do.  However, the glare that I am experiencing is intolerable, especially when the Web page has a black background.  I tried a matte anti-glare screen protector but to no avail.  The protector removed the glare but caused white backgrounds to be extremely pixelated, so much so that my eye strain was even worse than without the screen protector.  I am not against all glossy screens...I love my Macbook Air's screen.  However, the extra layer of glass on the Macbook Pro causes these horrible reflections that can not be mitigated by adjusting the screen angle.  Furthermore, even at the brightest setting, I see both the keyboard and my hands reflected in the black, glass covered bezel.  Perfect solution would be to use museum glass or no glass at all with a black, non-reflective bezel.  When Apple offers that, I will buy it.  Until then I'll keep using my Cube and 20" matte LCD display for my desktop (and hope it doesn't die) and the Macbook Air for my laptop.	2.0	3.822746753692627
Small and lightweight - quick  I bought this notebook a month ago. It's tiny and lightweight, which is great when traveling. When I am not traveling, which is most of the time, it's a little too small. The monitor is 12.1", but with LCD prices dropping, I guess I'll buy one soon. The keyboard is too small for comfort, but I bought the Logitech Wireless Desktop from Amazon for 29.99. The USB ports and all other ports are one the side, which is a little messier than having them all in the back. The fan was a little noisy, but I calibrated it, and now it's fine. It runs extremely well, and I guess all in all, I am very happpy with my purchase. The price is great with this much memory, HD space, and a DVD-RW. I give it 4 stars.	4.0	4.021528244018555
when it worked, it was decent.  I bought this computer for gaming, i figured the specs were good so i'd get it.(i got mine at bestbuy.) i had it for a few months and then the internet stopped working along with the disc drive and webcam. I brought it into geek squad, they sent it in, a couple weeks later, we called and they said it started over heating on them. After they got that fixed and i went to pick it up they told me they didn't fix the internet 'cause it was a software problem and was not under warranty. I talked to some of my computer savvy friends and they said it was a mistake to buy a gateway in the first place. Since then other things have gone wrong with it as well. So overall if you want good specs that DON'T last long, this is the computer for you! Also, some of the games i was trying to play at full quality were lacking.. Its running vista at 64 bits which takes up most of the RAM it has.	3.0	1.9987614154815674
alright well to start off the computer wasn't for me, i was just the purchaser and the one who inspected the item lol.  to start off its a macbook, i am an ASUS fanboy so receiving anything that wasn't of the same type or even of same operationg system was a bit daunting. i have always disliked apple products for reasons that i will not dispose of. nonetheless the product was as ordered and of the specs that was stated. came in a very timely matter and in great condition i might add.  we ran through the battery the moment we received it charging then burning it out and we received nearly the max amount of time that u should expect from a mac battery around 5 hours or so at max brightness running videos. the screen was nice and clear and honestly nothing screamed refurbished about this computer accept normal small spots of wear on edges and on thebottom  overall very satisfied	4.0	3.093515634536743
Disappointed  My computer crashed the first day I got it.  It gets really hot, fast.  I don't see that happening with the Dell or the HP laptops in this house. I must agree with one reviewer who mentioned that Vista seems incompatable with this computer.  I removed the heavy power draining virus program it came with and purchased ESET Node 32 which is a light fast and effective virus protection.  I also purchased and installed RegCure registry cleaner seems to help,  but still this is a troublesome product I would not buy again.  For about the same price my daughter got a stay cool HP with built in video camera. The 17" would be nice if the computer didn't require an inconvenient cooling pad.	2.0	1.9920976161956787
Not Worth The Money  I hoped for a lot more from this laptop. It looks decent on paper but it's a very poor performing machine. It is so fragile I am afraid to pick it up. It performs all the basics like surfing and basic apps but can't run too many processes at the same time. The video and audio quality are poor. It came with no recovery disks or instructions. I can't get a decent wireless signal no matter how close I get. The plastic case scratches easily. Maybe for $500 I would give it 3 stars. I am returning it before the 2 week trial period expires.	2.0	2.011237382888794
Best consumer level laptop!  The Macbook does it all.  I can burn DVDs/CDs.  It has garageband, itunes, imovie, iphoto.  It does everything a consumer laptop should do.  AND EVERYTHING JUST WORKS!!  That is the best thing about the Mac.  It works....there are no blue screens of death, no conflicts......  The Leopard operating system is far ahead of Vista.  In fact, you'll find that many windows users are downgrading back to XP.  Do yourself a favor and get a Mac....get this Macbook and you'll never go back to windows.	5.0	5.004115581512451
MacBook Pro, nice, but not THAT nice  OK, my new MacBook Pro is nice. It's fast. It's not a PC. It doesn't feel cheap like most PC laptops. My configuration is same as the item sold here, but with 1GB RAM.  The MacBook isn't THAT great. It's even worse than the PowerBook from a truly usability standpoint. Here's the inherent problems that are not Mac or PC related, just lousy engineering standpoint:  1. External audio input jack does not work with normal headsets. It is not a microphone jack, but a "line level" jack, which means it works with my stereo, but not with non-powered headsets like the ones you are likely to already have for chatting on VOIP or webcasts. This is ridiculous, as it would be a piece of cake for Apple to add another mic-in jack or, better yet, make this jack compatible with unpowered microphones.  2. Bluetooth doesn't work with the bluetooth telephone headsets I've tried. These same headsets work fine with an IBM laptop that have built-in BT. There is no technical reason for the headset to not work, it just doesn't, so it's lousy engineering and/or programming.  3. There is no S-Video or RCA video output, so no way to connect it to anything but an external computer monitor. The PowerBook had this. Again, shame on you Apple for not anticipating the need to output to something besides a computer monitor with a laptop.  4. NO MODEM ! This is ABSOLUTELY ridiculous. Now I know that everyone in Cupertino has access to T3 broadband in there RangeRovers, but out in the rest of the world MOST people only have access to analog phone lines. SHAME ON YOU Apple for not putting a modem on a MOBILE COMPUTER, a computer that is MOST likely to go places where there is no broadband. PowerBook had this.  5. No PCMCIA/PCCARD slot. Huh? It has some other slot that nobody has heard of.  6. MacOSX is cool, but there are some things that aren't that great. Help is awful. For example, there is nowhere in help that tells you that a normal headset microphone won't work, so you spend a long time digging through technical specifications or searching forums to find out on your own. Something else that help didn't help with is figuring out how to get the sound input from the audio-in port to come out the built-in speakers (strangely enough, this is EASIER to do on a PC, unless I am just  ignorant and don't know the "trick" to make this happen on a Mac).  7. The screen opens to only about 115 degrees (just past perpendicular to keyboard), which is not enough for when the LAPtop is on your LAP. It should open to at least 180 degrees, or better yet 360 to let you look straight down at it for when it is at a lower position than when you are sitting in front of a high tabletop. Again, most PC laptops do open well past 90 degrees.  So, without the built-in features that should be mandatory on a laptop, this expensive laptop is basically a small desktop, but without all the expansion capabilities that a desktop has. The old G4 PowerBook is a better package than the MacBook Pro, but the MacBook is faster. As an example of Apple's "excellent" design and engineering, this laptop is a flop, ESPECIALLY for $2k.  If this computer hadn't been supplied by my employer, I would have gone with a G4 PowerBook or a supremely equipped PC for about half the price. This is my first Mac laptop, and I am disappointed.  --John	3.0	3.0385193824768066
contact us doesn't contact  There is no way to reach "technical assistance" via the email address offered.  I emailed and a month later I'm still waiting for the reply.  The keyboard is too small for my fingers - "help" page offers limited help for operating instructions.	2.0	1.9993962049484253
Simply the best laptop out there...PERIOD!  Simply the best laptop you can buy....PERIOD.  I've been a Windows user for over 16 years and this is the first MacBook I have ever purchased. After waiting, scrimping, saving and begging, I finally got one. I can't describe how happy I am with this laptop. It simply works...it does what it is supposed to do and it does it very well. There is nothing I miss about a Windows laptop, not one single thing. I admit, the applications, like Pages (word processing) and stuff take a little getting used to, but that is to be expected.  I do admit, being in the field that I'm in, I will HAVE to get another Windows based laptop sooner or later, but I can tell you it will only be for work. This MackBook is going to be the primary laptop for years and years to come. My next laptop/PC will be a Mac, the next computer I recommend for family and friends is going to be a Mac. Apple has a new fan, simply for creating a product that does what it is supposed to do. It's very refreshing to have that for a change. Thank you Apple.  If you are in the fence about getting an Apple product, do yourself a favor and get it, trust me, you won't be sorry.	5.0	5.020507335662842
Just what I wanted  I bought the Asus eee laptop just before going to China for two weeks. I was hoping I could access email and upload photos during our trip but I didn't want to lug a full-size laptop.  It worked perfectly!  This is the perfect travel personal laptop (I wouldn't try to substitute this for a work laptop).  With all the loaded software, we didn't have to do anything except turn it on.  It easily found any wireless networks and connected to them flawlessly.  I was able to upload pictures to our web account and send out emails to friends so they could see the pictures while we were still in China.  I didn't give it 5 stars because of two issues. The first is the small keyboard. It is cramped and often I would hit the wrong key. The "B" key also stuck a bit.  OTOH, my children think the keyboard fits them perfectly. The second issue is that ironically at home the laptop will not always connect to our home wireless network automatically - I have to type in the WEP key.  This started happening when I updated the BIOS. Previously, the computer connected without any problems.	4.0	3.460528612136841
Don't buy this laptop if you plan to use it outside the US  Let me put some context here, I was on a trip to the US, wanted a very nice Gaming laptop and found this one in a very convenient price, I bought it through a retailer in the Amazon website. Excellent service from the retailer, it arrived were I was on time, the laptop comes with a backpack and a precision mouse. The backpack is nice but the fabric it is made of seems to be a knock-off, not a good quality fabric, but nice gift though.  The laptop is powerful but it is filled with crapware which I uninstalled, not nice to include crapware that will slowdown your system and you will end up uninstalling. The bottleneck I noticed is the Hard drive, the system slows down because the slow HDDs for laptops.  However the nightmare started 1 month after I purchased it, once I was outside the US, the applications started to crash, Windows too, I reinstalled and the same thing happened, I ran some memory tests and noticed that there was an issue, as I am a computer guy and with no ASUS warranty or ASUS representation in the country I live, I decided to troubleshoot the issue myself. To open the laptop you will need experienced hands, and that goes to the average guy who wants to upgrade the RAM or the HDD. It is complex to open up this laptop.  When troubleshooting the RAM issue I detected that 2 RAM bays(2 and 4) were defective, that was going to reduce the capacity of the laptop from 6Gb to 2 Gb (because you need to fill up the slots sequentially) unless I buy a 4Gb DIMM. Anyways, suddenly the computer didn't boot up. You may think I made a mistake, a short circuit, probably or probably not. The thing is that after I searched through forums I found out this issue is very common for this model. The mother board seems to be faulty and the solution is to send it back to ASUS to get a new or refurbished mother board installed in your laptop.  This is why I give it two stars and not one: - I knew the risks of buying a laptop overseas with no support in the country I live in. - The model seems to have a glitch that ASUS has to fix and they are not making a recall for the model.  I went for the safest option here, I bought an Alienware, and will try to find a mother board on ebay for the laptop and hand it over to my little brother. So far 1,300 bucks went to the trash can.  Bottom line: If you live in a country where there is no ASUS support for this model, DON'T buy it, otherwise think twice to buy this model.	2.0	1.981852650642395
I thought this company was good but when I wanted to return this lab top back over two weeks ago I haven't heard anything back since. Really the lab top is the size and style I've wanted but I am having issues with the letter "P". I just quits when it wants and then types it when It is ready making it hard for me to type up my reports.  I told company that if they can replace it I would rather get it replaced with one that works than my money back but I haven't heard any thing. Other than that so far it is great. I got lab top before the delivery date its just the letter "P" that keeps sticking.	2.0	2.052987575531006
Get what you pay for...nothing more  I bought this computer for classwork in college. It's OK, but the biggest disappointment is the lack of Windows Office. It supposedly has Windows XP Pro, but Microsoft doesn't seem to recognize it as a legal copy (RED FLAG), and the cheap knockoff substitute for Windows Office, is just that a cheap knockoff. Come to think of it, I'm going to change it from three stars to two.	2.0	2.873624801635742

Sony's products become worse and worse  After I bought the laptop only for 3 weeks, so many issues happened:  1) DVD writer is not easily be used. No idea about how to use it.  2) Sony bluetooth mouse cannot be installed on the VGN-SZ110B  3) It needs to be recovered twice already !!  4) The amazon prices for the sell decreases continuesly, and make me feeling be cheated.	1.0	1.9456474781036377
Good Hardware, Bad Support  Awesome notebook if you stick with XP Home but HP Support will tell you they will not support XP Pro if you upgrade or fresh install. (But you can "Build To Order" straight from HP with Pro installed.) How odd that HP Support will tell you that they don't have the drivers.   While I had XP Home for a couple of days the one thing I did notice is the Wireless network "Monitor" would not report a connection correctly. Using Linksys Wireless-G Router (801.11b mode) I had a pretty good connection (30' + 1 Wall + 1 Window) however, while surfing the internet the network monitor was saying no connection.   I have since installed XP Pro and have not been unable to get the wireless to work.   Actual battery time is a little over stated as usual.  I'm averaging just over 2hrs actual up time on my machine which isn't long enough for some DVD's.  Better get an extra battery or auto/air adapter for this one if you plan on using any CPU/Graphic intensive applications on a long flight.   One more thing worth mentioning is it seems HP has gone to shipping there product without installing the "Pre-installed" software.  Upon first boot I was left at a completely fresh OS with nothing on it.  You have to dig for their application software to install the things you want (i.e. DVD software, Corel, Acrobat Reader.)  I personally like this method but they don't tell you clear enough in the instructions, like place this notice first in the "Quick Start" guide or something.	4.0	2.652829885482788
What good is a laptop without software?  I purchased this laptop in August 2005 with the understanding that it came loaded with Windows XP home edition.  I found out that the software loaded was a trial version (good for 60 days)and when I attempted to enter the software's "permanent" keycode, I got an "invalid keycode" message.  According to Toshiba's tech support, I have to purchase the software at an additional cost of $200.00.  I could have saved some money and aggravation by buying a different brand.  I would not recommend the Toshiba.	2.0	1.9987660646438599
One Flaw that kills my love for it  I bought my Sony from Circuit City in 2007. I loved it, it has all kinds of cool things and once you uninstall all the lousy clutter it is beautiful. Then, right after my 1 year warranty ended several keys on the keyboard died. I did not spill anything on it. I still love my laptop, but this flaw makes it impossible for me to choose Sony again. The screen is great, the size and weight are wonderful, the sound is a bit quiet, but good enough for me. But a messed up keyboard sours all of that.	3.0	3.476116895675659

Almost a perfect laptop....  I owned 4 IBM laptops prior to this Macbook Pro 15, 2.4GHz, 2GB Ram,160GB HD. I used my Thinkpad X series for 3 years and finally it is now experiencing random blue screen of death (due to faulty aged motherboard or memory modules), which I am reluctant to buy replacement parts or repair (old 1.8GHz Centrino).  This is my second Mac (I bought an iMac 20" one year ago and really love it).  I've had this MBP for 3 weeks now.  The first unit I got had a faulty number "2" key on the keyboard.  I had it replaced and the store gave me a brand new one right after testing it.  He said it rarely happens for a mac to have faulty keyboard.  I bought the MBP right after the Leopard was released, hoping the Leopard would come preinstalled.  But it came with Tiger instead and has a drop in kit in the box.  It took me over 2 hours to upgrade to Leopard.  I won't take time to do what others have done; I'll briefly just go over some of the features I hope it could improve/should have included.  Let's face it, it is a $2500 retail laptop, it should come with a lot of features not found on a sub $1000 laptop computer:  1. louder speaker (louder and better low end sound) (some Toshiba and HP has much better sound than the MBP) 2. even though I probably won't use it, but a finger print security scanner would be nice 3. more USB ports (I think it has room for at least 2 more) 4. better cooling, it gets so hot after a while it became not laptop-able. 5. longer battery life (it gets about 3.5-4 hours now.  With the technology improvements on other aspects of the computer industry, I think it should be at least 5-6 hour range for even DVD movie playing.) 6. higher megapixel for the built-in camera. (it's only 2.0MP now) 7. upgrade option for 512M video card (it's only 256M now)  One week after I bought it, Apple offered the option to upgrade to 2.6GHz for another $250.  I didn't think the 0.2GHz was worth $250 so I didn't go back to the store to get it exchanged again.  I play a lot of music on my MBP that's why I really thought the speaker quality was not good enough.  Of course one could always add another external PC speaker, but I am just comparing to what I heard on other Toshiba or HP laptops in the same size/price range.  Overall:  Highly recommended.	4.0	3.97306489944458

If you are using a PC, go back to Mac  I got my iBook about a month ago and I love it.  I'd previously had a Mac in college and had been using a PC because of work for the past seven years and I'm no beginner user - fluent in just about every type of software out there from Office applications to video/audio programs.  After years of blue screens, 2 hour calls to Microsoft support, and unexplained program crashes/freezes, I am SO glad I went back to Apple.  The iBook has been an outstanding reintroduction.  For those of you worried about going back, I've found no problems with compatibility in transferring documents back and forth, the OS environment is very intuitive and takes little extra effort if you are familiar with Windows.  The iBook itself is a great value.  The 1.2 Ghz processor sounds small to Windows users, but it buries my old 2.0 Ghz Pentium3 that had 3 times the RAM of my little iBook.  The screen is sharp and impressive, the battery life is good (not quite the 6 hours advertised, but a solid 4-4.5 hours), its incredibly portable, the full-size keyboard is easy to use, and I've easily integrated the iBook at home for the full desktop experience with a regular monitor, wireless mouse, and external drive (to make up for the small hard drive).  Having to buy Microsoft Office was definitely a negative of the iBook, but it was definitely worth the extra cost.  And the iLife, iTunes, Quicken, and basic software included with the iBook is all really great.  Best of all - it never crashes!!!  I've gone back to Apple, and I'm never going to stray again.  I only wish I'd gone back sooner.  Get an iBook.  You'll love it.  Its like getting your first computer all over again.	5.0	5.011176586151123
Hard drive failed within first year  I bought this laptop from Best Buy for my daughter.  She complained that it was always freezing and was very slow.  I tried doing all the usual maintenance (defragmentation, deleting temporary files, checking for updates and patches, scanning for virii, etc.) but nothing helped.  Finally, the hard drive failed.  The good news is that it was easy to replace the old drive with a better quality Western Digital drive.  The bad news was that I had to order (and pay for) backup media from Sony to reinstall the OS.	2.0	1.9041178226470947
Machine is too fragile  My wife bought me a Macbook Pro 15 about 6 weeks ago.  I'm on my 3rd machine in 3 weeks.  This is ridiculous.  The first one lasted about 3 weeks before the battery swelled to the point that it made the trackpad inoperable.  Luckily it was within 30 days of purchasing from Best Buy, they exchanged it for a new one.  This is fortunate since I first called apple and they wanted me to send it in for a repair that was going to take 4-6 weeks to complete.  I was not willing to spend this kind of money on a laptop and have it in for repair longer than I had it.  The new one was only two days old and I picked it up by the screen and the glass cover fractured.  Now this is something I have done with larger Windows based laptops for 10 years and have never had an issue. Took some arguing with Best Buy but they exchanged it again for a new one. I'm afraid to use this thing for fear of denting the aluminum housing, or damaging it again.  But my trusty windows laptops have travelled the world with me and never had these types of issues.  Aside from how fragile and delicate this laptop is, I love the macbook it is fast and it is awesome to use,  too bad I'm afraid to take it out of the house with me.	1.0	2.0325915813446045
Don't buy a used computer  I did not like this product because it didn't work properly. I wanted it to give it to my sister. Since it was cheap I that it would be great to give her. She needed one.

Satisfied but not delighted  Overall it is a great computer. Some facts to keep in mind: 1) Windows Vista is nice but really slow, sometime it can be annoying, but I didn't install de XP that comes in a cd because I didn't want to mess up things. 2) Video memory is not as powerful us I expected. But it still works for some light applications. 3) The keyboard is not us nice us expected for this kind of product. 4) Brilliant processor, really fast, specially on 3D rendering. 5) Ram memory is enough for almost any task, what will keep your times down is video efficiency. 6) Screen is good. Size is good but not as light us expected. 7) Battery leakage is a problem if you are travelling and don't want to carry the AC adapter.	4.0	2.963120698928833
Freezing problem  I had to return mine within 2 weeks after I received it due to a problem with it freezing up on me.  I called Acer customer service at least 3 times for this problem and I had to reload my computer twice and the problem kept happening.  Customer service was good, but maybe this one was just a lemon.  Overall, besides the freezing problem, I think it's a good price for what you get (if you get one that doesn't have any problems) and it's small which makes it very portable.  Returning it was very easy and Amazon customer service was very good. Thank you	2.0	2.244110345840454
Excellent Notebook!  I always do a lot of research when I buy a new computer.  Toshiba (and Apple) got the best rating for quality with the least amount of major repair problems.  Beyond that though, I have owned a number of Toshiba notebooks and have had almost no problems.  I considered Sony, but for the same power, I would have had to pay much more.  Beside, why would I want to pay for something with less of a quality rating?  As for this notebook. This is simply one of the most powerful notebooks for the money.  The resolution is great, fast and quiet Centrino processor, the 1 Gig of RAM makes a significant difference, the video driver is powerful, the hard drive is maybe too big, the Super DVD drive is a great bonus too.  If you are look for the best bang for the buck, buy this machine.	5.0	5.008269309997559
Compaq Presario CQ50 10/30/08  All in all I am happy with my purchase of the Compaq Presario CQ50. It provides the capacity I need for my small business. I would warn the buyer that the installed Mircosoft Office and Norton Anti-virus are trial versions and only good for 2 months, therefore you should expect to spend several hundreds dollars more for the software. This makes the purchase price not such a bargin at the end of the day.	3.0	3.394286632537842
